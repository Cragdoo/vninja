The [recent](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmwares-mystic-marvin-project/) [speculations](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/marvin-speculation/) surrounding Marvin has now hit [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/10/vmware_to_build_converged_compute_and_storage_ihardwarei/) (to bad they don't link this way, but I guess thats how it is) as well, but one piece is still missing, arguably the most important one.

How about this one:
