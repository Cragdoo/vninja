Over the last couple of weeks an idea started to form, an idea that would try to combine two of my passions; **The vCommunity and photography**. 

In short, the idea is to set up some kind of mini-studio at VMworld Europe, and offer free [headshots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shot) to those who might be interested.

So far there seems to be quite a bit of interest in doing this, so I'll **try** to make it happen! I'll show up with my camera, you just show up.

I might have bitten over more than I can chew though, especially considering that there were 14.000 attendees at VMworld Europe 2017. I have no idea, yet, what my schedule at VMworld Europe 2018 looks like but my plan is to block out an hour of each conference day (5-8 November) for this on a first-come-first-served basis.

The plan is to set up the small studio, take the headshots and publish them all publicly (probably in a Flickr album) with a [Public Domain Dedication (CC0) license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) â€” Free for all to use.

Of course, there are quite a few practical and logistical issues to deal with in order to actually making this a reality, most pressing is the need for a proper location for the shoots, or getting hold of a backdrop setup that I can use anywhere. All of the collapsibe backdrops I've found so far are simply to large for me to stick in my suitcase.
