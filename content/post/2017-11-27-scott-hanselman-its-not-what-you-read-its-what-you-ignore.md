This is the second recorded talk published in the [Awesome Talks](http://vninja.net/awesome-talks/) series. This time it's [Scott Hanselman's](https://www.hanselman.com/) "**It's not what you read, it's what you ignore**" talk from Dev Day in Kraków way back in 2012.

This isn't a technical talk, it's originally geared towards developers but Scott's message should resonate with everyone in the tech field. In general, it's about how you can deal with large amounts of information. Lot's of great takeaways here!

**Enjoy!**
