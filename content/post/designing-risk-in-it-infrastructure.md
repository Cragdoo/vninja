This book wil help you understand what risk really is, a variety of different risk factors and how to mitigate them. <br/>

**Do you know what risks exist for a given solution, and why?**

**Do you factor in, and calculate risk when designing the architecture? If so, how do you do it?**

**Risk analysis, do we need it?**

Daemon does a great job explaining all of this, and risk analysis is an often underappreciated exercise that we leave to late in the design process:

<br/>

Besides having a wealth of information, perhaps sometimes to much to ingest in a single sitting, it's also packed with great (and funny) examples, quotes and historical factoids. This is a book you'll have to read more than once, and use as a reference later on.

This is the third book in the IT Architect Series, after [Foundation In the Art of Infrastructure Design: A Practical Guide for IT Architects](http://www.lulu.com/shop/john-yani-arrasjid-vcdx-001-and-chris-mccain-vcdx-079-and-mark-gabryjelski-vcdx-023/it-architect-series-foundation-in-the-art-of-infrastructure-design-a-practical-guide-for-it-architects/ebook/product-23278130.html) and [The Journey: A Guidebook for Anyone Interested in IT Architecture](http://www.lulu.com/shop/melissa-palmer-vcdx-236/it-architect-series-the-journey-a-guidebook-for-anyone-interested-in-it-architecture/hardcover/product-23298646.html)


**Note:** My recommendation of the book is based on the chapters I've reviewed, and not the final printed product.
