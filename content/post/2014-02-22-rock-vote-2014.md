![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/Rock_the_Vote_logo.png)Once again, it's time to vote for the top VMware & virtualization blogs.  As usual Eric Siebert has opened up the floodgates and set up a voting system, and once again managed to create a lot of work for himself.

So, let's all make it worth his while and get as many votes in as possible! There are a lot of blogs listed, this time there are over 300 in total.

Cast your vote, and get more information about the process:
