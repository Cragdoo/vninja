As [Eric Siebert](https://twitter.com/ericsiebert) has pointed out, the [VMware vSphere release cycles are shortening](http://vsphere-land.com/news/vmwares-ever-shortening-release-cycle-for-new-hypervisor-versions.html).

While vSphere 5.1 could be seen as a bit rushed, especially in regards to SSO, when it was released, the shorter release cycles seem to work out pretty well.

This does make me think though; vSphere 5.5 is pretty much ready to be released to the general public, and the new [VSAN](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2013/08/26/introduction-vmware-vsphere-virtual-san/) component will be in a [public beta](http://www.vmware.com/vsan-beta-register) at the same time.

_Does this indicate that VMware might actually be moving to a more modular approach, with different release cycles for different components?_

I can see how this works for "add-on" products like [Horizon View](http://www.vmware.com/products/horizon-view/), [VDP](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/features-data-protection)Â and so on, but for "core" components like a new the local storage layer this is a new one.

**Is this a new modular approach or is due to the fact that the release cycle this time around was too short to get VSAN included? **

Or, perhaps is it as simple as [Jason A Linden](https://twitter.com/jlinden7/) just suggested on Twitter; [VSAN will be included in vSphere 5.5 Update 1?](https://twitter.com/jlinden7/status/378266692293390336)
