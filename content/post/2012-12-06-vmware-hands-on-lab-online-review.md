A little while ago VMware announced [Project Nee](https://www.projectnee.com), something I was, and still am, pretty [excited about](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/right-vmware-training-certification/).

This afternoon I finally got access to the [Hands-on Labs Online Beta](https://www.vmware.com/landing_pages/hands-on-labs-beta.html) part of Project Nee, and I _have_ to say, this looks incredibly promising and useful.

At the moment, the available labs are:<!-- more -->

Clearly there is a good collection of good content here, and as the catalog gradually expands I´m sure we´re in for a lot of great lab modules still in development.

## User Experience:


For now I´ve only done a quick run through of the _ _**HOL-OPS-01** - VMware vCenter Operations Manager Enterprise lab, but I must say that the user experience was responsive and intuitive. I had no problem navigating the lab environment and accessing the virtual machine consoles directly in my browser (Safari). The lab guide/manual was clear and to the point, and even included troubleshooting steps in case something didn´t behave as expected.

This is, as far as I can gather, this is the same platform Project Nee will use for the online training VMware will offer in the future


## My Verdict:


I´m impressed. The Hands-on Lab Beta looks great, and behaves according to it´s appearance. As the content catalog grows, this will quickly become an invaluable resource for every vAdmin out there, my only concern is how it will be priced when it hits general release.
