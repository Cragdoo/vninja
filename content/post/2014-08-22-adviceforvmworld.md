VMworld US is very soon upon us, and I'm one of the jealous ones left behind not being able to attend. I will hopefully be able to join everyone oat VMworld Europe in Barcelona on October though.

An interesting Twitter hashtag [#AdviceForVMworld](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AdviceForVMworld&src=tyah) appeared a week or so ago, with lots of good advice for people attending a huge tech conference.

Here are a few good examples:

All of these, contain some good advice and make perfect sense. This has also spurred a very blog posts [VMworld Mobile Toolchest](http://www.eigenmagic.com/2014/08/15/vmworld-mobile-toolchest/) by [Justin Warren](https://twitter.com/jpwarren).

This one however, made me cringe and actually scared me quite a bit

Is the state of affairs so bad that there is a need to remind other human beings to change their underwear and take care of personal hygiene? After all, people who attend VMworld are largely people who are either responsible for running the IT infrastructure for large and small companies, or people who want to be in that position. Do we actually leave our Data Centers in the hands of people who needs this kind of advice?

I know that the track record for tech conferences is shady,[especially when it comes to how we as a collective treat women at such events](http://www.buzzfeed.com/courtneystanton/a-woman-walks-into-a-tech-conference), and that is simply disgraceful. The fact that we seem to have a need to tell people to wash, shower and clean themselves up in addition to not being misogynistic assholes saddens me. I have not personally witnessed any harassment at the VMworld's I have attended, this is meant as a general comment.

I guess my only real solid #AdviceForVMworld is this:
**Be human. Use your brain. Don't be an asshole.**

If everyone does that, we'll get along just fine. If not, I hope someone tells you to shut up and leave.
