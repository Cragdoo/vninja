Ravello![ravello_logo-2](/img/ravello_logo-2-e1434699655395.png) Systems has [announced free lab service](http://www.ravellosystems.com/go/vexpert) for all 2015 vExperts, which offers 1,000 _free_ CPU hours per month for personal or home lab use.

I was lucky enough to be one of the early VMware on AWS VIP Pass users, and I've been working on several setups the last few weeks. Hopefully I'll be able to make those available as blueprints in the new [Ravello Repo](http://www.ravellosystems.com/repo), once they are ready for publishing.

My experience with Ravello Systems so far can be summed up with one word: Awesome. The ability to quickly fire up a test environment, especially with [nested ESXi hosts](http://www.ravellosystems.com/technology/hvx), is fantastic. In fact, a lot of the things I've been using my home lab for, has been transitioned over and run on demand on Ravello instead. The CPU and RAM requirements for a home lab has increased dramatically over the last few years, and the investment needed in hardware makes it difficult to keep it up to date. Now, my existing home lab can work for some workloads and scenarios, others run on AWS via Ravello when I need them.

_It's the best of both worlds, just the way I like it._
