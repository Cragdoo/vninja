The [fourth edition (Big Fat Pipes with Bob)](http://vsoup.net/2011/02/vsoup-big-fat-pipes-with-bob-episode-4-2/) of [the vSoup podcast](http://vsoup.net/) is now available. This time we had the honor of having [Bob Plankers](http://twitter.com/plankers) as a guest. Bob runs [The Lone Sysadmin](http://lonesysadmin.net), where his recent post "[Blame](http://lonesysadmin.net/2011/02/08/blame/)" really resonated well with me personally.

The fact of the matter is that in many cases Bob is right, virtualization admins ends up being blamed for everything. 



<blockquote>No matter who’s fault it actually is, though, I’m the one-stop shop now for blame.</blockquote>



How very, very true.
