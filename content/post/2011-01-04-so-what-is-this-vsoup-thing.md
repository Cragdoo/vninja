Some times things just happen, and before you know it you're sitting in your in-laws living room talking to an Englishman and an American via Skype. And to top it of; it's all being recorded. And to make matters even worse, we decided to try and make it a regular thing. The recordings that is, not the "in your in-laws living room" thing, that was a one-off for sure.

What I'm trying to say here is that yours truly, [Ed Czerwin](http://twitter.com/#!/eczerwin) and [Chris Dearden](http://jfvi.co.uk/) has decided that we want to be rock-stars and start our own little virtualization related podcast.

The first episode of vSoup is now available, head on over to [vSoup.net](http://vSoup.net) to check it out, and remember, we are all virgins here. Be gentle.
