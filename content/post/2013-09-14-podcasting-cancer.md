Some times all it takes is one single tweet to set things in motion:

<blockquote>Just a year after losing Dad to cancer, Mom's has now spread from lung to other areas. Too soon for this shit.

— Gabriel Chapman (@Bacon_Is_King) [September 12, 2013](https://twitter.com/Bacon_Is_King/statuses/378283415839051776)</blockquote>


This started a spiral of tweets, discussions and ideas being thrown around and has now resulted in [Podcasting for Cancer](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/podcasting-for-cancer).

**The current goal is to raise $5000 USD by November 12th - Let´s absolutely crush that goal!**
