![recording photo](http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4698e4136cb25d23d2ee4441_150_recording.jpg)I was invited by Nick Martin and Tom Walat to join them in this pre-VMworld edition of the podcast, so if you're not bored reading about my [Marvin](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmwares-mystic-marvin-project/) [speculations](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/marvin-speculation/) already, you can now listen to them as well over at [This Week in Virtualization](http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/podcast/VMware-Marvin-speculation-and-VMworld-expectations)[ by SearchServerVirtualization](http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/podcast/VMware-Marvin-speculation-and-VMworld-expectations). 

It also covers some expectation for VMworld 2014, which is rapidly getting closer.
