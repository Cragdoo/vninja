Some time during the [Podcasting for Cancer](http://podcastingforcancer.org) fundraiser period I somehow suggested that we should pair it with this years [Movember](https://www.movember.com).

Despite my wife and daughters strenuous protests, I signed up and went all in. By all in, I mean, all in. For the first time since I went to my then employers christmas party dressed as a woman, I shaved my whole face.

My trusty goatee, who had been pretty much constantly with me since 1997, was gone. I looked like I was 12 years old.

And to be honest, it went pretty much downhill from there.

[I would like to thank Matthew Northam, Arjan Timmerman, Duncan Epping, Eric Sloof, Marco Broeken and Julian Wood for their Movember donations in my name.](http://mobro.co/h0bbel)

Sorry guys, but this is what you actually paid for.  It´s not pretty, but it is what it is. Remember, you have been warned.

I guess that if this IT and virtualization thing doesn't work out, I can always audition for a part in Sons of Anarchy...
