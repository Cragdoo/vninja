## Technology







  * [**Send a Tweet Directly from a VMware ESXi Host**
](http://www.vcritical.com/2016/11/send-a-tweet-directly-from-a-vmware-esxi-host/)Admittedly sending Tweets from an ESXi hosts doesn't really make much sense, but as an example of how to use the new Script Bundle feature in Auto Deploy for vSphere 6.5 it's pretty cool — Kudos [Eric Gray](https://twitter.com/eric_gray)


  * [**OPBOT - Connect VMware vSphere and Slack**
](http://try.opvizor.com/opbot/)Ok, this is right up my alley. Opvizor has created what they call a Virtual Assistant for vSphere. Basically this is an appliance you deploy in your environment (stripped down Debian), which lets you connect your Slack channel to your vSphere environment and then lets you issue (read only) commands to it.


  * ****[Quick Look – vSphere 6.5 Storage Space Reclamation
](http://anthonyspiteri.net/quick-look-vsphere-6-5-storage-space-reclamation/)****[Anthony Spiteri](https://twitter.com/anthonyspiteri) wrote this most excellent guide to how UNMAP works in vSphere 6.5. Once in a while (honestly, more often than you would think) someone beats me to posting something, and this is one of those times. Very glad to see automated UNMAP being re-introduced in 6.5.


  * [**Predictive DRS Walk Through**
](https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2016/11/predictive-drs-walk.html)Another awesome feature made possible by the combination of vSphere 6.5 and vRealize Operations 6.4. Have a look at the video, it explains it all.


  * **[Getting Started with vRealize Automation 7
](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/getting-started-vrealize-automation-7)**[Eric Shanks ](https://twitter.com/eric_shanks)has a new course available on Pluralsight. I've had a quick look at this one, and it looks awesome. Definitely bookmarked for later!


  * **[Amazon Re:Invent New Products and Services
](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/)**Wow, lots and lots of new interesting AWS things to play with. To be honest I haven't looked at it all yet, but this is quite the list.





## Other







  * [**Recommended Reading**
](https://www.eigenmagic.com/about/recommended-reading/)[Justin Warren](https://twitter.com/jpwarren) has a list of his recommended books and essays, covering a wide variety of topics. Well worth checking out!


  * **[Life Gets (a Lot) Better When You Stop Giving a F*ck
](https://medium.com/the-mission/life-gets-a-lot-better-when-you-stop-giving-a-f-ck-dbf96255e069#.wiycudmhk)**The title pretty much says it all, do yourself a favour and spend 5 minutes reading Thomas Oppongs article.


  * **[More young people are watching Planet Earth 2 than The X Factor
](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/planet-earth-2-ii-young-viewers-x-factor-bbc-itv-david-attenborough-vieiwng-figures-ratings-a7449296.html)**There is hope after all!



That's it for this week, a new one is in the works for next Friday.
