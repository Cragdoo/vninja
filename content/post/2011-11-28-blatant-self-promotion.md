As the title says, it's been one of my more "public" weeks ever. Besides my "normal" [vSoup](http://vsoup.net/) engagement, this week I've also been involved with [Mike Laverick's](https://twitter.com/Mike_Laverick) [VMTN Subscription Movement Miniwags](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/category/vmtn-subscription/) to voice some of my views about the [#VMTNSubscriptionMovement](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23VMTNSubscriptionMovement).

**Fair warning:** _This is video, and please to remember that during recording [Movember](http://uk.movember.com/mospace/2006730/) was nearing its final phase._

Secondly, I was a guest on the [Veeam Community Podcast Episode 45 – vSphere 5 Storage Potpourri](http://veeam.podbean.com/2011/11/28/episode-45-%E2%80%93-vsphere-5-storage-potpourri/).

Third, and last, [SearchServerVirtualization](http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/) posted [VMware vSphere Storage Appliance: Devil's in the details](http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/news/2240111622/VMware-vSphere-Storage-Appliance-Devils-in-the-details) which also includes some commentary from yours truly regarding the VSA.
