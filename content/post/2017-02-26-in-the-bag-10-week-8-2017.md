Welcome to the tenth edition of In The Bag!
This one comes a little late, it's (barely) Sunday here, not Friday! Sorry about that, but I was "stuck" in a secure facility all week, doing a vSphere 5.5 til vSphere 6.5 migration.

## In The Bag #10 - Week 8 2017





## Technology







  * **[osx-wificleaner
](https://github.com/mubix/osx-wificleaner)**Over time, we all accumulate a bunch of open networks that we've connected to — **you do use a while connected to those, right?** This little MacOS script will clean those right out of your network list, which is a good thing. For one, cleaning out those open networks makes sure your laptops doesn't reconnect to them automatically, and secondly manually cleaning up that list is pretty tedious after a while.


  * [**VMware Technical Papers**](http://www.vmware.com/techpapers.html#/?client=tech_paper&num=25&filter=0&site=tech_paper&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&getfields=*&partialfields=(default:default)&requiredfields=&entqr=0&start=0&sort=meta:revisionDate:D&tlen=200&numgm=3&cn=vmware&cc=en&cid=&tid=&stype=main)
Handy little site that makes it easy to find those Technical Papers you're looking for. Filter by product and read your heart out.


  * **[VMware IOInsight
](https://labs.vmware.com/flings/ioinsight#summary)**Nice new Fling from VMware Labs. Ever wondered how your VMs IO characteristics are? Well, IOInsight will give you that, erm, insight in a web based GUI.


  * **[How I Ruined Office Productivity With a Face-Replacing Slack Bot](http://blog.zikes.me/post/how-i-ruined-office-productivity-with-a-slack-bot/)**
And people say slackbots are useless.





## Other







  * [**Complicated. Weird. Beautiful! The secret Google project to put an aquarium full of tiny, wiggly water bears inside your phone
**](http://venturebeat.com/2017/02/24/complicated-weird-beautiful-the-secret-google-project-to-put-an-aquarium-full-of-tiny-wiggly-water-bears-inside-your-phone/)Yes. Of course. Whut? I bet the new Nokia 3310 won't have that!


  * **[A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music](http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/)****
**Well worth a read. I'm not big on ambient much as such, I'm still mostly stuck in my long-gone youth and 90's grunge, but I might just be coming around.
**

**That's it for this week — Enjoy your week come.
