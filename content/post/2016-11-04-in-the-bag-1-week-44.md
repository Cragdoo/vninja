Inspired by [Scott Lowe's](https://twitter.com/scott_lowe) [Technology Short Takes](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2016/10/10/technology-short-take-72/), [Duncan Eppings](https://twitter.com/DuncanYB) [Recommended Reads](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2016/09/18/duncanybs-recommended-reads-part-5/) and [Michael White's](https://twitter.com/mwvme) [Newsletter](https://notesfrommwhite.net/category/newsletter/) here is my attempt at a weekly roundup of things I found interesting the last week or so.
<!--more-->

I've been playing with the idea of doing something like this for a while, but never really got started. Due to participating in (http://discoposse.com/vdm30in30/) this year (30 posts in 30 days is a lot), I figured this was as good a time as any to get started — at least I can get 4 "free" posts out of it.
** Hopefully I'll be able to keep it up and post these roundups every friday, at least I'll give it a good go.**

Naturally my focus for these will be technology and virtualization, but other random content might pop up as well. I'm still working on the format, and it'll probably evolve as I get into a workflow.

Anyhow, here it is, the first edition!



## **In The Bag #1 - Week 44**





##### Technology







  * [Why I moved from NFS to vSAN… and why it went wrong](https://www.vcloudnine.de/why-i-moved-from-nfs-to-vsan-and-why-it-went-wrong/) by [Patrick Terlisten
](https://twitter.com/pterlisten/)A perfect example of what you need to consider when designing a vSAN environment, and what happens if you don't.


  * [VMware SDDC Technical Whiteboard](http://www.virtualjad.com/2016/10/vmware-sddc-technical-whiteboard.html) by [Jad El-Zein
](https://twitter.com/virtualjad)Jad has made a really good whiteboard video (wow, VideoScribe looks good) on VMware SDDC. Nicely done!


  * [vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 What’s New Rundown by](http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/) [Emad Younis
](http://emadyounis.com/author/eyounis/)The VCSA is my preferred vCenter implementation model, and now that 6.5 is announced, it's even more clear that the VCSA should be, and is, the default model going forward.


  * [Designing a modern multi-tenant DC network](https://blah.cloud/architecture/designing-modern-private-cloud-network/) by [Myles Gray](https://twitter.com/mylesagray/)
I'm not a networking guy, but Myles has posted a whopper around _designing_ a DC network. Very well done Myles!





##### Other







  * [Takeoff: The Oral History of Nirvana’s Crossover Moment
](https://medium.com/cuepoint/takeoff-the-oral-history-of-nirvana-s-crossover-moment-1b12603ed5f#.1ly8au604)This is an older post (from May 2015), but I read it this week so it still qualifies.
I'm still a big Nirvana fan, and I love reading stories like these.


  * [vRockstar 2016 Pictures are online!](http://vrockstar.eu/the-vrockstar-2016-pictures-are-online/)
Pictures from this years vRockstar Party in Barcelona. Good times, and yeah, Sorry.



That's it for the first version, hopefully many more to come in the next weeks and months.
