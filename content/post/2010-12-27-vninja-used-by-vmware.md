Thanks to [Maish Saidel-Keesing](http://twitter.com/maishsk), vExpert 2010 and blogger over at [Technodrone](http://technodrone.blogspot.com/) I have been made aware that VMware has used one of my posts here on vNinja in their internal presentation material.

The material in question is [vSphere 4.1 to 4.0 differences](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-13450) (page 44 and 45 in vSphere 4.1 Deep Dive - Part 1 - v6.pptx), where my post about [Using USB Pass-through in vSphere 4.1](http://vninja.net/virtualization/using-usb-pass-through-in-vsphere-4-1/) is quoted and my screenshots used. I guess no-one else had tested USB passthrough in vSphere 4.1 with USB based UPS setups before I did.

While I think this is great, and I'm really honored that my content here can be used as internal VMware resources, I must say that I would have loved to be notified, and asked, by [Iwan Rahabok](http://virtual-red-dot.blogspot.com/) when he created the material. Iwan did provide links and source attribution in his presentation, but a direct message from him would have been great as well.
