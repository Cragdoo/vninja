How long asÂ [NSX for vSphere 6.0.4 Documentation ](https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/nsx_pubs.html)been publicly available? I just noticed this, and that the NSX downloads seem to be available via MyVMware - If you are entitled to it that is.

Does this mean it will be available for download and we get to play with it soon-ish? It might have been available earlier too, unnoticed by yours truly...
