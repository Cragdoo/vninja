  * [**Extending the Capabilities of vRealize Automation 7**](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/extending-capabilities-of-vrealize-automation-7)

  * **[Designing vSAN Networks – Why Should I Use the Distributed Switch?
](https://blogs.vmware.com/virtualblocks/2017/01/19/designing-vsan-networks-use-distributed-switch/)**The short answer is yes. The _why_, is clearly illustrated in this article

](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML3gkL-6N8)Wow. I'm having problems learning to play guitar, and that's one thing at at time.


  * **[Experience: I accidentally bought a giant pig](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/experience-i-accidentally-bought-a-giant-pig)**
It's just one of those things you know, the things that just happen...



That's it for this week — Enjoy your weekend!
