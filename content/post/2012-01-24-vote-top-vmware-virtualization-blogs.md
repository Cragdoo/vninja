[![vote for pedro](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3146/2776192987_386ca5332c_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/c32/2776192987/)[Eric Siebert](http://twitter.com/ericsiebert) has opened up the voting for the [top VMware & virtualization blogs](http://vsphere-land.com/news/voting-now-open-for-the-top-vmware-virtualization-blogs.html). Head on over and cast your votes!

Votes for [vNinja.net](http://vNinja.net) and [vSoup.net](http://vSoup.net) would be greatly appreciated, but since we´re not affiliated with the [Dutch vMaffia](http://twitter.com/dutch_vmaffia) we promise that you will not have to wear concrete boots or wake up to a horses head in your bed if you don´t vote for us.

We think.
