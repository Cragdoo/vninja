I love it when a plan comes together, especially when someone gets an idea and then someone fires on all cylinders and executes!

As [mentioned before](http://vninja.net/virtualization/vmworld-session-reject-club/), there has been a lot of talk about various ways to create a "soapbox" for all those who submitted VMworld sessions and got rejected, or those who did not submit but would still like to present.

Thankfully the guys behind [vBrownBags](http://professionalvmware.com/brownbags/) has teamed up with VMware communities and are now offering this opportunity at VMworld 2012. I am not sure if this also extends to VMworld Europe, but it is happing in the US event at least.
