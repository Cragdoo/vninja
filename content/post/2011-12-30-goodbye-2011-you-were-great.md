Yes, this is YAEotYP, so if you've already read tons of them I apologize.



### 2011 - My personal view



2011 has been a steamroller of a year.The [vSoup Virtualization Podcast](http://vSoup.net) got aired the first time, and we've recorded and published 19 full episodes in the inaugural year. I was awarded the [vExpert](http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/) title for the first time, and even got invited to [Tech Field Day #6](http://techfieldday.com/2011/tfd6/) in Boston. 

In addition to this, I wrote a [white paper for Veeam](http://go.veeam.com/wp-2011-christian-mohn-7-expert-tips-managing-remote-vsphere.html), was included in the [Server Virtualization Advisory Board](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/server-virtualization/announcing-our-new-advisory-board-member/), joined [Rick Vanover](http://twitter.com/RickVanover) for a [Veeam Community Podcast](http://www.veeam.com/podcast/episode-45-%E2%80%93-vsphere-5-storage-potpourri.html), and appeared in two video interviews. 

One with [Mike Laverick](http://twitter.com/mike_laverick) about the [#VMTNSubscriptionMovement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO8qU_5JgB8) and one where [Eric Sloof](http://twitter.com/esloof) [ambushed me with a camera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnBi7A5xn88) while visiting Bergen.


Lots of exiting projects were started in 2011, including my [PowerCLI based automation project for vessel installations](http://vninja.net/virtualization/auto-installation-and-configuring-of-vsphere-esxi-5/), migrating from standalone ESX hosts to blade servers (HP c7000 + Virtual Connect/Flex10) in addition to the normal day to day operations and after 8 years at [Seatrans AS](http://seatrans.no), I handed in my papers, moving on to a [new role for EDB ErgoGroup](http://vninja.net/news/my-personal-vmotion/).




### 2011 vNinja.net Statistics


2011 was the first year this site existed, so I can't really compare the traffic it has received with 2010, but based on the few months it existed in 2010 the traffic increase has been enormous.

And that's it for 2011. Personally 2012 looks even more promising, and hopefully my exposure to more diverse environments should be reflected back on the site as I'm certain it will spur more posts and more interesting discussions. See you in 2012, I think we're in for a cracker.
