William Lam has a repository of [vCenter Web Client customizations](https://github.com/lamw/customize-vsphere-web-client-6.0u2) hosted over on GitHub, and I decided to add one of my own.

Simple, but kind of fun. Photo credits go to [gratisography.com](http://www.gratisography.com)

I have a couple of other ideas as well, so I might make a few more, but I'll wait until vSphere 6.5 is released in case the formats and paths change again. After all the new VCSA is based on [VMware Photon](https://vmware.github.io/photon/), so things might just moved around a bit.
