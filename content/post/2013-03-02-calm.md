I needed some new wall "art" for my home office, and decided that a couple of small "[Keep Calm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On)" posters would do the trick.  Naturally I got a bit carried away, and created more than one, and of course, most of them are virtualization related:



If you have some ideas, I´ll gladly create more, just leave a comment! I would also love photos if you printed out any of these and put them on a wall or in a frame somewhere. Or even better, on a T-Shirt!
