This is the third talk I've found worthy of publishing in the [Awesome Talks](http://vninja.net/awesome-talks/) series. Enjoy [Simon Wardley's](https://twitter.com/swardley) Researcher, Leading Edge Forum, keynote from [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2018](https://kccnceu18.sched.com/event/EDv7/keynote-crossing-the-river-by-feeling-the-stones-simon-wardley-researcher-leading-edge-forum?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) called "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones".

Simon's presentation technique, flair and master of language is flat out impressive — and fun!
