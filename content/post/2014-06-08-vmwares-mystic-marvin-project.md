[![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BpgDQmDCYAESs-A.jpg:large)](https://twitter.com/cocquyt/status/475133344837935104)Yesterday [Fletcher Cocquyt](https://twitter.com/Cocquyt) posted a rather interesting photo on his Twitter account:

This is, as far as I know, the first public sighting confirming the existence of the "[mystic](http://www.crn.com/news/data-center/300071991/sources-vmware-building-project-mystic-converged-infrastructure-appliance-for-emc.htm)" project Marvin that VMware is working on. The text reads "_Introducing the worlds first 100% VMware powered hyper converged infrastructure appliance_." I guess some of the VMware engineers forgot that the VMware campus get external visitors from time to time...

So what is it? Well, there aren't many details available but [Marvin is indeed a registered trademark](http://trademarks.justia.com/861/60/marvin-86160864.html), by VMware. According to the trademark registration, it's purpose is pretty clear:

<!--more-->


<blockquote>Computer hardware for virtualization; computer hardware enabling users to manage virtual computing resources that include networking and data storage.</blockquote>



It has previously been speculated that VMware was building a hyper converged solution with EMC, but I doubt that EMC is the only OEM player here. VMware has a history of working with several vendors, and not just the mothership. I guess we'll have to wait until VMworld US to get the full stack shimmies, but I don't think there is any doubt that this will be based on vSphere and VSAN and perhaps even a scaled down version of NSX.

I like the idea of "roll your own hyper converged stack", based on an appliance model. After all, and I'm paraphrasing [Joe Baguley](https://twitter.com/JoeBaguley) here:



<blockquote>Is your solution really software defined, if it requires specific bits of tin to work?</blockquote>

Bring on VMworld, I really want to meet Marvin, but lets hope he's a bit more upbeat than the original from [Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Marvin):



<blockquote>Marvin is a severely depressed robot. He's regularly so depressed that, when he gets bored and talks to other computers, they commit suicide and die.</blockquote>



I guess we all should bring our own towels to this one.
