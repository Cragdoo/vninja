  * **[In-Guest UNMAP Fix in ESXi 6.5 Part I: Windows
](http://www.codyhosterman.com/2017/03/in-guest-unmap-fix-in-esxi-6-5-patch-1/)& [Part II: Linux ](http://www.codyhosterman.com/2017/03/in-guest-unmap-fix-in-esxi-6-5-part-ii-linux/)
**Cody Hosterman has tested the UNMAP fixes in ESXi 6.5, with great results. Glad this is back!


  * **[High frequency of read operations on VMware Tools image may cause SD card corruption (2149257)](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&externalId=2149257&sliceId=1&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&dialogID=355414078&stateId=1%200%20355416185)
**This one is important! If you're running ESXi 6.0 from SD cards, make sure to check this. No patch available for 6.5 yet though.


  * **[My Windows 10 Template Build Process](https://thevirtualhorizon.com/2017/03/13/my-windows-10-template-build-process/)**
[Sean Massey](https://twitter.com/seanpmassey) has published his Windows 10 VM template process, loads of great tips and tricks for tuning your VDI templates here.


  * [**How to build a Windows 2016 VMware Template**](https://notesfrommwhite.net/2016/12/11/how-to-build-a-windows-2016-vmware-template/)
An older article, but [Michael White](https://twitter.com/mwvme/) has a great guide on building a Windows 2016 template as well.


  * **[2-node vSAN topologies review
](http://cormachogan.com/2017/03/10/2-node-vsan-topologies-review/)**Newly appointed director [Cormac](https://twitter.com/CormacJHogan) goes through a couple of various 2-node vSAN topologies, and supported vSAN witness placement.


  * [**vCenter 6.5b Resets Root Password Expiration Settings**
](https://lonesysadmin.net/2017/03/16/vcenter-6-5b-resets-root-password-expiration-settings/?utm_content=buffer3eb0c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)I've verified this in my own lab as well, and I think it's very unfortunate that this upgrade to vCenter 6.5b does this. Shout-out to [Bob Plankers](https://twitter.com/plankers) for discovering this.
