I have given the site a small facelift, replacing the old theme with a new and cleaner version. For some reason, I get this "theme itch" a couple of times a year, but usually I manage to let it pass without doing many changes.

This time it stuck with me though, and ended up with replacing the old theme with a new one. In fact, the old theme had been active for close to two years now, so it was time to shake things up a bit any way. The new theme gives the site a fresh and in my opinion better look. The double menus in the header makes it look more organised, and less cluttered and the static navigation header is something I've wanted to have for a long time now.

It just looks simpler and cleaner, especially with regards to font faces and sizes.
