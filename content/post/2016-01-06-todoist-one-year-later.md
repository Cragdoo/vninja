A little over a year ago I posted [Combining Todoist and Evernote, because awesome](http://vninja.net/workflow/combining-todoist-evernote-awesome/) and I thought it was about time to post a follow up now one year later.

## Evernote:



Firstly, my [Evernote](http://evernote.com) is still a giant mess, just as it was a year ago. I have lots of data in Evernote, but it's main purpose is just storing quick notes on ongoing projects and it serves as a basis for generating proper documentation. For that purpose it works really well, but I can't seem to be able to actually use it for much beyond that. For me, Evernote is the equivalent of a _shed_: _A place you put all your stuff, only to realize you never use it again._

Since my original post, I've stopped my **Todoist Task -> Evernote IFTT** recipe. After all, it did was to store even more unneeded stuff in my shed.



## Todoist:



![Todoist2](/img/Todoist2.png)2015 was the first full year I've used [Todoist](http://todoist.com) as my primary task manager. 722 completed tasks later, and I couldn't be happier with it. _It's easy to work with, very flexible, and doesn't get in the way._ I have the iOS app running on my phone, the desktop application running on OS X and the Outlook plugin running in my corporate VM.

It helps me focus on the things I need to get done, and if I need to take notes or document things in relation to those tasks, I create Evernote notes for them manually.  I've tried several ToDo task managers in the past, but Todoist is the first one that's stuck with me.

Plus, completing a task given me [Karma](https://todoist.com/karma) points. I like karma, especially when it goes in my favor.

Now, of course, I have to do _some_ automation. Everything I tag with "_reading_" in Pocket, gets added to my "_To Read_" project in Todoist. That provides me with a nice list of things I've been meaning to read later, all within the same interface as my daily tasks.

Has it made me more productive? I don't know. What I do know is this: **It certainly makes it much harder to forget to do something, and that can't be bad.**
