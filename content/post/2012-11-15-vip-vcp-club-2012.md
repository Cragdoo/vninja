![](/img/VMware-VIP-Club-300x67.jpg)VMware Norway held their first ever _VIP VCP Club_ yesterday in Oslo.


## **What is VIP VCP Club? **


This a new concept by VMware Norway, for certified VMware professionals, where the idea is to gather local certified VMware Professionals for a day of hands-on labs, specialized technical sessions and general community building.


### Agenda:

Juggling for the Crowd

  * **End User Computing

  * **vCenter Operations Management Suite
**Presented by [Ulf Andreasson](http://twitter.com/sn00fy)


The hands-on labs covered _VMware Site Recovery Manager_, _vCenter Operations_ and _Horizon Suite_.

The event itself was great, _especially the speaker quality!_ Sadly the hands-on labs had too little time allotted to them, making it was practically impossible to finish the labs in the timeframes given, but we did get to play around a bit!

Thank you VMware Norway in general, and [Stein](http://twitter.com/zztony) in particular, for making this a reality. I look forward to the upcoming events!
