[Sammy Bogaert](http://twitter.com/boerlowie) has posted a 12 part series called "[Building The Ultimate vSphere Lab](http://boerlowie.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/building-the-ultimate-vsphere-lab-part-1-the-story/)", which knocks the socks of my previous vSphere 4.x series. 

In reality this means that my planned series for vSphere 5.x is now cancelled, as there is no need to duplicate Sammy's efforts. Be sure to check the series out!
