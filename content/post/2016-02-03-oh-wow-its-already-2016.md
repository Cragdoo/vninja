A bit late, considering it's already February, but here it is:

# My plan for 2016.
<!--more-->

  * **Shake things up a bit** - **Go big or go home.** 2016 will be a year of changes. It's about time I _shake things up a bit_, and 2016 will be that year. More details on this to come later, for now I have to keep it under wraps.



  * **Get VCIX certified** - I've signed up for the new [3V0-622: VMware Certified Advanced Professional 6 - Data Center Virtualization Design Beta Exam](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=88743&ui=www_cert). This will be my first ever VMware beta exam. If I fail that one, I will try again later in 2016 to obtain the [VCIX certification](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=52165&ui=www_cert).



  * **Keep vSoup on track** - We've committed, at least to ourselves, that in 2016 we will record [vSoup](http://vsoup.net) monthly.



  * **VMUG** - The [Norwegian VMUG](http://vmug.no) is up and running, but I would like to get even better attendance records and more community contributions._The sponsors pays the bills, the community contributions brings the most value._
In the spirit of the [Feed4ward program](https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=7221) I'll be happy to mentor/help anyone who wants to present at a VMUG meeting in Norway.
I intend to arrange at least 3 VMUG meetings in Bergen in 2016.



  * **Attend an international industry conference** - In 2015 I missed out on VMworld entirely, due to issues out of my control. My goal is to make sure I attend a least one industry conference this year, most likely VMworld 2016 in Barcelona.



  * **Code something** - My ambition is that some time in 2016 I will code something. It's very clear to me that even though I'm in no developer by nature, a basic developer skill set is required by everyone these days. Me included. I'll consider this my wildcard project for 2016, as I haven't decided on what to do yet, or even how.






In general, I will continue writing and posting whenever I feel like it. I will also focus even more on public cloud offerings, and especially how to integrate then with existing on-premises solutions. Since these are more general goals that are hard to put into a measurable format, I'll refrain from putting them down in the list as individual entries. Of course, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry; 2016 might just move me into other directions too.
