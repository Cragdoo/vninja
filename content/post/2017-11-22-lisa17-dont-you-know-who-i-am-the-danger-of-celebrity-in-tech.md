This is the first post, in what hopefully will turn into a series of posts, highlighting awesome talks that are freely available. There is a lot of great content out there, both inspirational and funny, and I'll try to publish my favorites when I find them.

**So here is the first one!**

John Nicholson [shared](https://twitter.com/lost_signal/status/933291400996700160) this awesome talk by [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/@QuinnyPig) from [LISA17](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17), which should be **mandatory** for anyone attending conferences, or talks in general. Not only does it dive into the culture of asking questions when attending a talk, but also has lots of good information for speakers as well. Trust me, this is ~44 minutes very well spent.
