Yesterday I arrived at [Logan International](http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/Pages/Default.aspx) for Tech Field Day #6 in the greater Boston area. [Christopher Wells](http://twitter.com/wygtya) had already arrived earlier in the day, and I was lucky enough to be picked up by [Stephen Foskett](http://twitter.com/sfoskett) at the airport and chauffeured to the [Sheraton Framingham Hotel and Conference](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=756) center.

The travel itself was pretty uneventful, the only trouble I had was that when I landed at Schipol for transfer to the US flight, my boarding pass was nowhere to be found, and I don't think I even received it when I checked in at Bergen Airport Flesland. At the self-service transit counters at Schipol I even got told, by the machines, that my reservation was non-existent. Of course, this was kind of troubling, but thanks to the very nice and service minded KLM employees at Schipol, that issue was quickly resolved and I was on my merry way. At least as merry as one can be when traveling transatlantic. 

The flight from Schipol to Logan was incredibly boring though.Normally I have no problems sleeping while flying, but this time around I got the grand total of zero minutes of sleep on the entire trip. Add in the 6 hour time difference, and you've got one tired traveling vNinja on your hands.

![](http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/316569365.jpg)Stephen and I met up with Chris Wells at the hotel, and went out searching for dinner. Stephen, who seems to know everything there is to know, and then some, about Boston and the surrounding areas, guided us to a local Indian restaurant where we got some great [Thali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thali). 

After that we ended up at the [Horseshoe Pub & Restaurant](http://www.horseshoepub.com/) for some vTFDbeers! How many beers do they have on tap? Who knows, all I know is that it's [a lot!](http://www.horseshoepub.com/beer_list.html). I haven't seen that many beer taps since I was at The Gingerbreadman in New York many moons ago.

As you can clearly see, the world has indeed survived the first ever meetup between the vSamurai and the vNinja. Meeting up with both Chris and Stephen was a real treat, and I can't wait for the rest of the delegates arrive during the day, [Tech Field Day 6: You look awesome.](http://techfieldday.com/2011/tfd6/)
