Just like [last year](http://vninja.net/news/vmware-forum-2011-oslo/), I got up really early and caught a 06:40 am flight from Bergen to Oslo to attend the [VMware Forum](http://www.vmwareforum2012.com/Oslo/). A couple of things have changed since the last time, one of them being the venue.

This time around it was held at [Ullevaal Business Class](http://www.ubc.no/), and the venue itself worked great for a one day conference like this, divided into three sections, two for parallel sessions and one for the exhibitor area.

One of the other changes from last year, is that I now work for a VMware Partner, who was also a Platinum Sponsor of the event. This was my first event working for a partner, and I even had booth duty! Talking with customers in a partner setting is quite different from being a customer yourself, so that was interesting in an of itself. Sadly this also meant that I missed most of the sessions, but I did manage to catch the keynote by Brian Gammage, VMware´s Chief Market Technologist.

I even got a "1-on-1" session with Mr. Gammage, accompanied with a couple of my colleagues from [EVRY Consulting](http://www.evry.com/it-services/consulting-services-/technology-consulting1/), which was **really** interesting to say the least. Listening to someone _extremely_ knowledgeable and visionary, in a small non-speaking setting was an eye-opener with regards to how VMware sees the future of end user computing. Sadly I can´t go into details about it, but I´m confident that VMware has a strategy in the works that might just surprise more than a few people.

Unfortunately this "1-on-1" session collided with both [Joel Lindberg´s](http://twitter.com/#!/viewgeek) and [Lee Dilworth´s](http://twitter.com/#!/leedilworth) sessions, so I didn´t catch any of those, which in reality was the two sessions I was looking most forward to beforehand. Also, what´s up with scheduling both those sessions against each other, that sounds like a bit of bad planning from the organizing committee.

I did however get to meet both of them in the exhibition area, even if only ever so briefly. I also met up with both [Vegard Sagbakken](http://twitter.com/vegard_s) and [Stein Willhelmsen](http://twitter.com/#!/zztony) from VMware, [Mike Beevor](http://twitter.com/#!/mikebeevor) from Whiptail and [Linus Svensson](http://twitter.com/#!/Linuss72/) from Veeam.

All in all I think VMworld Forum 2012 in Oslo was a step in the right direction compared to last year, but it´s still not a very technical event and I don't´really think it is supposed to be. Perhaps my expectations for it last year were a bit high, and this year they might just have been a bit to low.

Oh, I even spotted [Cody Bunch´s](http://twitter.com/#!/codybunch) Automating vSphere with VMware vCenter Orchestrator book in the wild!
