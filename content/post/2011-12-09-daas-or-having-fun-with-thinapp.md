While using ThinApp to create a standalone version of [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/) 0.38.2, since the newly announced 1.0 version looks, acts and feels like a 0.1 version, I posed the following question on Twitter:



<blockquote>["Hrm, what other apps should i #ThinApp while I'm at it?"](https://twitter.com/#!/h0bbel/status/145249562490179585).</blockquote>


[Kevin Kelling](http://twitter.com/BlueShiftBlog) immediately responded with ["Doom"](https://twitter.com/#!/BlueShiftBlog).

Naturally, I decided to give it a go. A quick download of [ZDoom](http://zdoom.org/News) later, and a quick run through the ThinApp Setup Capture later, the following was born (view in full screen for better viewing):
