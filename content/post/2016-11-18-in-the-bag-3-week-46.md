**In The Bag #3 - Week 46**

##### Technology







  * Slow news week, not much happening really. Oh wait, there was this thing called vSphere 6.5 that was released. [William Lam](https://twitter.com/lamw) has the lowdown in his [All vSphere 6.5 release notes & download links](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2016/11/vsphere65.html) post. Please read the release notes. They are important.


  * [Veeam Availability Suite 9.5](https://www.veeam.com/data-center-availability-suite.html?ad=menu-products) was released too. No vSphere 6.5 support as of yet, so if you depend on Veeam Backup and Replication for your backup needs it's best to wait a bit.


  * [How the Top vBlogs are performing (or how to optimize your WordPress site)](http://vsphere-land.com/news/how-the-top-vblogs-are-performing-or-how-to-optimize-your-wordpress-site.html)
[Eric Siebert](https://twitter.com/esiebert) has written a nice article to show how you can optimise your website, and get a nice Grade A. This site needs a run through that as well, mostly due to some laziness on my part.


  * [Regex that only matches itself](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/28821/regex-that-only-matches-itself/31863?stw=2#31863)
Regular expressions, or Regexp scares me. I've never gotten to grips with it, and when someone does something like this my face goes numb and my mind goes blank.





##### Other







  * [Classic Pop Songs, Reimagined as Infographics](https://thebolditalic.com/classic-pop-songs-reimagined-as-infographics-29fe12f925fb#.r811tnhx0)
 This is fun! How many of these song lyrics can you recognise from the infographics?


  * [The Lost Civilization of Dial-Up Bulletin Board Systems](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/)
I grew up on Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), literally. Back in the early 90's I even ran one of my own, with a dedicated phone line and all. Little know fact: That BBS is still up and running today!


  * [Leonard Cohen on Kurt Cobain's Nirvana lyric name-check: 'I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man'
](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/leonard-cohen-on-kurt-cobains-nirvana-lyric-name-check-im-sorry-i-couldnt-have-spoken-to-the-young-a7410941.html)Yes, another Nirvana related link. Sorry (not sorry).



That's it for this week, a new one is in the works for next friday
