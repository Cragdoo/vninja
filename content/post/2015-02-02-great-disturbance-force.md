So, the cat formerly known as vSphere.next is finally out of it's rather big bag, and vSphere 6.0 has been officially announced and will be available some time in Q1 (no date has been announced yet). There is [enough of posts](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2015/02/vsphere-6-0-vexpert-blog-articles.html) going into details on what is new and what has been announced, so I won't be going over that right now. If you want to hear me talk about vSphere 6.0 and related news, you can always attend [VMUG Norway on the 19th of february](http://vmug.no/pamelding-vmug-bergen-19-februar/).

I do however have some other comments to make, and perhaps some observations that might have passed below radar altitude in all the announcement hoopla.

Some read this as "VMware is shifting to offering new features on their own cloud services first, then on premises later", I don't. I believe this means a monumental shift on how VMware is handling releases and offering new features. I wouldn't be suprised if vSphere 6, and related products, **is one of the last or even the last monolithic release they do.**

My take on this is that VMware is moving towards adopting more of a cloud culture in how in handles development. Goodbye [waterfall development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) and Hello Agile development. Sure, Agile development and cloud provides checkboxes in any decent buzzword-bingo game, but if we are to believe in Cloud, DevOps and a truly Software Defined Data Center, the color of the development carpet needs to match the drapes.

It's not about treating on-premises customers as second class citizens, it's about actually practicing what you preach. The next big thing might just start as a fling and end up as a feature, and you might not have to wait until v7.4 to get it.

**"Cloud first" doesn't mean "vCloud Air first", it just means that you and me can get our hands on the naughty bits earlier.** I must admit, I kinda like that. Of course, all of this is just speculation. _There might not be a carpet to match at all._
