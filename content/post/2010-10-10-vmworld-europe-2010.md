[VMworld Europe 2010](http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/europe2010/) is close. Very close. In fact, lots of people are already in place in Copenhagen, personally I don’t get until tomorrow evening (the 11th).

 

Since I get in pretty late, I really hope I’ll be able to get to my hotel quickly, and then find [Custom House](http://www.customhouse.dk/en/) for the Tweetup/VMUG Party. 

 

Remember I have a [little contest going](http://vninja.net/virtualization/going-to-vmworld-europe-2010-contest-where-is-christian/), where you can win a copy of [Trainsignal VMware vSphere Pro Series Training Vol. 2](http://www.trainsignal.com/VMware-vSphere-Pro-Series-Training-Vol-2.aspx).

 

In case you are wondering how to find me, well I’m not really sure how you should go about doing that. Use your imagination!

 

If you do need some help locating me, check my [twitter stream](http://twitter.com/h0bbel) and/or [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/user/h0bbel) and [here is a recent picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/h0bbel/5069101334/) as well.

 

Good luck!
