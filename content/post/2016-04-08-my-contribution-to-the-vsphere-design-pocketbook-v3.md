![vSphere Design Pocketbook v3](http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pocketbook_3_web-250.png)

PernixData, and [Frank Denneman](http://frankdenneman.nl), has released [vSphere Design Pocketbook v3](http://www.pernixdata.com/resource/vsphere-design-pocketbook-30-social-media-edition). As the title reads, this is the third time PernixData releases one of these books, and I'm honored to be selected amongst the contributors for the [second time](http://vninja.net/virtualization/pernixdata-vsphere-pocketbook-blog-edition/), this time with a chapter called "**VCSA vs Windows vCenter - Which One Do I Choose, and Why?**"

Go grab your [electronic copy](http://www.pernixdata.com/resource/vsphere-design-pocketbook-30-social-media-edition) now, and be sure to bug your local PernixData representative for a hard-copy later._ I know I will._
