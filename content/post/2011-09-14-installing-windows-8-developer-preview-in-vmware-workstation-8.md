Installing Microsoft Windows 8 in a VMware Workstation 8 VM turned out to be a real piece of cake. 

Follow the screenshots for the procedure I used, but basically all I did was to create a new VM with the pre-configured "_Windows 8 Server_" preset and inserted the [downloaded ISO file](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/home/).

_Note: Windows 8 Server has been removed as a preset option in the final release of VMware Workstation 8, my screenshots are from the beta version. If you want to install Windows 8 in the GA version of VMware Workstation 8, you'll need to do a manual install (as opposed to Easy Install). Use the Windows 7 option as a baseline._

Networking, sound and other virtual hardware issues were non-existing, everything just works right out of the box (or .iso as the case is). Adding more than 1GB memory to the VM also helps a lot when it comes to it's responsiveness.
