**Eric Siebert** has yet again pulled through, and organized his annual top VMware & virtualization blogs vote, and the [results are now in](http://vsphere-land.com/news/2014-top-vmware-virtualization-blog-voting-results.html). Congratulations to everyone involved, be it bloggers, podcasters or otherwise engaged in making this possible.

This year, Eric hosted a live Google Hangout session with **John M. Troyer**, **David M. Davis** and **Rick Vanover** where the top lists were revealed, be sure to check it out:

As far as results go, I'm very happy that you guys voted vNinja in at _#43, of a total of 320, up a whopping 30 places since last __year_. This is the first year that vNinja breaks into the top 50, something that is very much appreciated.  vNinja was also listed in the independent category, where it was placed at a very, very, respectable 18th place!

_What is even more fun though, is that [vSoup](http://vSoup.net) was voted the 2nd best Virtualization Podcast, only beaten by those pesky [vBrownbag](http://professionalvmware.com/brownbags/) guys. _

As an added bonus, I even won a [Google Chromecast](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/) for voting, and whats even better is that I get to give away one to one of vNinja's readers as well!

So, if you want a free Google Chromecast, shipped directly your way, you have to **send in a photo of yourself, your wife, kids, grandma, cat or dog, dressed as a ninja**. That's right, dress up someone as a ninja, snap a photo and send it my way either via Twitter or as a comment on this post, and I'll pick the best one. _The winner gets the Chromecast. Entries sent in before April 30th will be judged, so get to it!_
