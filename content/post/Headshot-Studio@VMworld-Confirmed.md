title: "Headshot Studio @VMworld Confirmed"

description: "Over the last couple of weeks an idea started to form, an idea that would try to combine two of my passions; The vCommunity and photography. In short, the idea is to set up some kind of mini-studio at VMworld Europe, and offer free [headshots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shot) to those who might be interested."
