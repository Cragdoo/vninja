I'm very happy to announce that I can now confirm that [Headshot Studio @ VMworld](/2018/09/02/headshot-studiovmworld/) will happen! Mainly due to [Tom Dodds](https://twitter.com/@Tom10ZiGTech) and [10ZiG](https://www.10zig.com/), who has stepped up as a sponsor!  This means I'll be able to set up a small headshot studio, complete with multiple light sources, a background, and softboxes! **Huge thanks to both Tom and 10ZiG!**

I'm still looking for a place at the Fira to host it all, as well as the details on how to actually organize it, but so far so good. The logistic challenges of getting the required equipment to Barcelona has been solved, the rest is pretty much up to me.

I have a couple of feelers ut there with regards to the physical location, but I'll have to get back to that closer to the event.

Thanks to Dave Simpson, who coined the term HaaS aka *Headshot-as-a-Service* for this!

I'd also like to thank the [vBrownbag](https://vbrownbag.com/) crew who actively supporting this! Thanks for all you do for the vCommunity guys, it's greatly appreciated!

More details to come, closer to [VMworld Europe 2018](https://www.vmworld.com/en/europe/index.html), including more details on the where, when and how, as well as a sign-up form. See you there!
