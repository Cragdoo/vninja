For the first time since the [Veeam Vanguard](https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html) program was started in 2015, I will be able to join the Vanguard Summit! This years event takes place next week (October 15th to 18th) in lovely Prague, Czechia. I've been in Prague once before, on a school trip when I was 18. I have to admit that I do not really remember much of that trip though, for various reasons best left undocumented...

By the looks of it, Veeam has done a great job organizing the event, arranging travel and hotel accomodations for approximately 50 Vanguards from all over the world â€” That  take *some* organizing! There will be a realluy mixed bag of representatives from Brazil, the US, Australia, the Nordics, and all over Europe. This is the Vanguards chance to get briefed on new developments, but also a great way to provide feedback to Veeam as well. One of the really nice things about the Vangurd program is the two-way street nature of it, it's not just one-way communication from Veeam, they listen as well.

The event agenda looks great too, with a good mix of public content, enbargoed content and even some [Rickatron](https://twitter.com/RickVanover) special **TOP SECRET** content. There is even planned some "responsible enjoyment" in the evenings, and a boat trip with dinner on the Wednesday.

**Thanks a lot Rick and the rest of the Veeam Vanguard crew for arranging this, I am really looking forward to meeting a slew of old friends, and even more fun, a bunch of new ones I have yet to meet, at least physically.**

I will be bringing my camera, and hopefully get some good shots of Old Town Prague, especially since the hotel we are staying at is very centrally placed. Even the weather seems to be cooperating this week, with good autumn temperatures. It will make for a a great break from the near constant rain we've had here in Bergen, Norway for the last month or so.
