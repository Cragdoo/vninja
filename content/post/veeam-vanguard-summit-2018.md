For the first time since the [Veeam Vanguard](https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html) program was started in 2015, I'll be able to join the Vanguard Summit! This event takes place next week (October 15th to 18th) in lovely Prague, Czechia. 

Veeam has done a great job organizing the event, at least by the looks of it before it actually starts, arranging travel and hotel accomodations for approximately 50 Vanguards from all over the world â€” That does take some organizing! There will be a realluy mixed bag of representatives from Brazil, the US, Australia, the Nordics, and all over Europe.

The event agenda looks great too, with a good mix of public content, enbargoed content and even some [Rickatron](https://twitter.com/RickVanover) special TOP SECRET content. There is even planned some "responsible enjoyment" in the evenings, and a boat trip with dinner on the Wednesday. 

I'll be bringing my camera, and hopefully get some good shots of Old Town Prague, especially since the hotel we are staying at is very centrally placed.

**Thanks a lot Rick and the rest of the Veeam Vanguard crew for arranging this, I am really looking forward to meeting a slew of old friends, and even more fun, a bunch of new ones I have yet to meet, physically.**
