## Hey there, my name is **Christian Mohn**.

<p class="lead">
  Come say hello to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/h0bbel)!
<p>

I live in [Bergen, Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen), and I'm as old as the original Rocky movie. I currently work as a **Senior Solutions Architect** and **Technical Lead SDDC** for [Proact IT Norge AS](http://proact.no), working on building Norways best, and _strongest_, VMware SDDC practice. I'm a strong believer in that software is indeed eating the world.

I'm an IT industry veteran, podcaster, author and blogger with over 20 years of real world experience. For some reason, I'm an eight time [VMware vExpert (2011-2018)](https://vexpert.vmware.com/), and an inaugural vExpert vSAN, [VMware EUC Champion (2015-2018)](https://www.vmware.com/euc-champions/current-champions.html), ex-PernixPro, and four time [Veeam Vanguard (2015-2018)](https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html).


Currently serving as the vice-chairmain of the the [Norwegian VMware User Group (VMUG)](http://vmug.no) leadership team and has helped launch VMUG in three Norwegian cities; Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim.

  For more details on work experience, certifications and such, check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianmohn/). I tend to keep that as updated as possible.
<p>

On a more personal note, I'm married, have two grown kids and have a potentially overshadowing passion for football – I've been a football coach for various girls teams in Bergen for a total of 11 years. I prefer my coffee [black as midnight on a moonless night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PcoMrwEa5o), [beer with taste](https://untappd.com/user/h0bbel), and Whiskey that tastes like [peat fire](https://www.whisky.com/whisky-database/details/laphroaig.html).



I have some stuff hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/h0bbel/), including this entire site which is now published using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). Previous incarnations of the site has been published using Wordpress.

As I'm a rather passionate hobby photographer, you can find most of my published photos on [500px](https://500px.com/h0bbel). If, and I don't know why, you want to know what music I'm listening to, check out [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/h0bbel).
**Note:** My musical evolution seems to have stopped in the 90s.
