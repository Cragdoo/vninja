## Hey there, my name is **Christian Mohn**.

<p class="lead">
  Come say hello to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/h0bbel)!
<p>

I live in [Bergen, Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen), and I'm as old as the original Rocky movie. I currently work as a **Senior Solutions Architect** and **Technical Lead SDDC** for [Proact IT Norge AS](http://proact.no), working on building Norways best, and _strongest_, VMware SDDC practice, and I'm a strong believer in that software is indeed eating the world.

I'm an IT industry "veteran", podcaster, author and blogger with over 20 years of real world IT experience. I've been running blog of some sorts for the better part of those 20 years too, which is kinda scary.

For some reason, I'm an eight time [VMware vExpert (2011-2018)](https://vexpert.vmware.com/), and an inaugural vExpert vSAN, [VMware EUC Champion (2015-2018)](https://www.vmware.com/euc-champions/current-champions.html), ex-PernixPro, and four time [Veeam Vanguard (2015-2018)](https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html).

Once upon a time, I also wrote a book called [Learning Veeam® Backup & Replication for VMware vSphere](http://bitly.com/1qvBypQ).

I have also been featured as a cartoon, _twice_. Once for Rubrik who made [trading cards for VMworld 2017](https://technicloud.com/2017/11/22/vmware-community-vallstars/), and once for Proact who made a rather [spiffy animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzm79VWWXKs).

Currently serving as the vice-chairman of the the [Norwegian VMware User Group (VMUG)](http://vmug.no) leadership team and has helped launch VMUG in three Norwegian cities; Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim.

On a more personal note, I'm a father of two, husband of one, and I have a potentially overshadowing passion for football – I've been a football coach for various girls teams in Bergen for a total of 11 years.

**I prefer my coffee [black as midnight on a moonless night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PcoMrwEa5o), [beer with taste](https://untappd.com/user/h0bbel), and Whisky that tastes like [peat fire](https://www.whisky.com/whisky-database/details/laphroaig.html).**


I have some stuff hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/h0bbel/), including this entire site which is now published using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). Previous incarnations of the site has been published using Wordpress.

As I'm a rather passionate hobby photographer, you can find most of my published photos on [500px](https://500px.com/h0bbel). If, and I don't know why, you want to know what music I'm listening to, check out [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/h0bbel).

<!-- **Note:** My musical evolution seems to have stopped in the 90s, hence the quote below:
