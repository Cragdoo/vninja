One of the more popular posts, currently in third place, on vNinja.net is my list of [vSphere Client direct download links](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vcenter-client-download-urls/) posted back in **March 2012**.

Thankfully [William Lam had the same idea](https://twitter.com/lamw/status/512239798191284224), and got a new Knowledgebase Article published: [Download URLs for VMware vSphere Client (2089791)](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2089791). Please use that article as the official download link documentation from now on.
