[Autolab](http://www.labguides.com/autolab/), that awesome "little" thing that [automagically](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=automagically) builds a nested vSphere Lab environment for you, was definitely not put together by [Flint Lockwood](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0153486/bio) but by [Alastair Cooke](https://twitter.com/DemitasseNZ) ([www.demitasse.co.nz](http://www.demitasse.co.nz)). Unlike Flint´s inventions, this one actually makes sense and serves a purpose!

**Now, how sweet would it be to deploy Autolab without having to invest time, money and effort into acquiring your own hardware?**

Well, thanks to [baremetalcloud.com](http://www.baremetalcloud.com/), you might now actually be able to do just that (and more, if you wish). Of course, this is a paid service but [Mike Laverick](http://twitter.com//mike_laverick/) has secured a deal where the 100 first sign-ups using his promo code gets free credits to play around with!
