I think [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/) might have been onto something with "Make something happen", so I did.

Today was my last day at [EVRY](http://evry.no). Some might already have been aware of this, mostly because of [Hoff-Job-Announcement-as-a-Service](https://twitter.com/Beaker/status/704375129485156352), but also because of my own tweet as I left the EVRY offices in Bergen  as an employee for the last time:

The decision to leave EVRY was not an easy one, but it was time to try something else. I have nothing but respect for both company and my now former colleagues and I'm certain EVRY will continue it's mission to become the Nordic IT champion, and I'm also certain they will succeed.

My new role is as a _Senior Systems Architect _for [Proact IT Norge](http://proact.no), with a focus on VMware's SDDC stack. What that _really _means, remains to be defined, but I'm excited to start this new endeavour and be given an opportunity to help [Proact](http://proact.no) **design the data centres of the future. **Proact recently also won a [Global VMware Innovation Award for 2016](http://www.proact.no/Om_oss/nyheter/News-Detail/?releaseid=1118698), so I guess I'm at the right place at the right time when I now join [#teamproact](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teamproact&src=typd).

So, in the words of Jake and Elwood:



<blockquote>**Elwood:** It's 106 miles to Chicago, we got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark...  and we're wearing sunglasses.
**Jake:** Hit it.</blockquote>
