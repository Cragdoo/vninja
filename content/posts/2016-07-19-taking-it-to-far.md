A few days ago I decided to go full-on mad scientist in documenting my new home lab / network setup, and I've even created a [GitHub ](https://github.com/h0bbel/homelab)repository for it.

The idea is to create a framework for developing this kind of documentation, heavily influenced by the VCDX methodology and framework. Over time, [_Conceptual_](https://github.com/h0bbel/homelab/blob/master/Conceptual.md), [_Logical_](https://github.com/h0bbel/homelab/blob/master/Logical.md) and [_Physical_](https://github.com/h0bbel/homelab/blob/master/Physical.md) designs will be added, as well as configuration settings and operational procedures. Hopefully it'll also contain some useful diagrams.

There are even _Executive Summary_ and _Business Background_ sections, which admittedly makes no sense at all in this setting, but as an exercise in writing such documents they certainly serve a purpose.

It's built using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as the markup language, which makes it easy to edit, revise and ultimately maintain as a source controlled collection of documents.

**This is very much a work in progress, but if you have any input, criticisms or pure snark, bring it on!**

Of course, since this is my own personal home lab, it's not quite up to par as a real enterprise architecture, but it's still real to me.

Now, where is my lab coat again?
