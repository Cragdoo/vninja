Way back in the old days, you know when [VMworld 2012](http://www.vmworld.com/community/conference/us/) was held in San Francisco, I [tweeted](http://twitter.com/h0bbel/statuses/240541080448294912) that if someone could get hold of a VCP pin for me, I would be very happy.

Luckily [Paul Valentino](http://twitter.com/sysxperts) from [vCommunity Trust](http://www.vcommunitytrust.org) picked that up, and apparently went on [quite the scavenger](http://twitter.com/sysxperts/status/240548011812483072) hunt on my behalf.

Imagine my surprise today when this little square meter of carton appeared, courtesy of Mr. Valentino:

For some reason I suspected that Paul had not only shipped me a VCP pin and that there might be a couple of other things in the package as well.

Indeed, a VMworld 2012 Backpack filled with various items, like the [VMware vSphere 5.1 Clustering Deepdive](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2012/08/27/vmware-vsphere-5-1-clustering-deepdive-available-on-amazon-now/) book, the [NetApp Data ONTAP Edge VSA](https://communities.netapp.com/community/products_and_solutions/data-ontap-edge), and a [VMware Workstation 9](https://www.vmware.com/tryvmware/?p=vmware-workstation9) license key amongst other things (stickers, pins and a t-shirt).

Thanks a lot Paul, your VMworld [Marshall Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan) is very, very much appreciated!
