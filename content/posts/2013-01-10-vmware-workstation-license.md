[Christopher Kusek](http://twitter.com/cxi), who runs [pkguild.com](http://pkguild.com), has just announced that he is running a contest where you can [win a VMware Workstation 9 license](http://www.pkguild.com/2013/01/win-a-free-copy-of-vmware-workstation-9-andor-fusion-contests-ends-jan31/).

Seeing that announcement, and the fact that Christopher was nice enough to mention both me and [vNinja.net](http://vNinja.net) in it, I have decided to also give away a license that has been lingering unused in my possession way to long.

Instead of running my own contest, my license has been added to the existing contest so [head on over there to read all the details](http://www.pkguild.com/2013/01/win-a-free-copy-of-vmware-workstation-9-andor-fusion-contests-ends-jan31/).

If [VMware Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/overview.html) does not tickle your fancy, perhaps [Luigi Danakos](http://twitter.com/nerdblurt) [VMware Fusion 5- Contest](http://www.pkguild.com/2013/01/win-a-free-copy-of-vmware-workstation-9-andor-fusion-contests-ends-jan31/) is more up your alley.

**Good luck!**
