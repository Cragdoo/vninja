Working with the keyboard to move resize, focus and arrange your applications is a great productivity tip. When I changed from Windows to macOS a few years ago, I had a pretty [convoluted setup based on Slate](http://vninja.net/osx/slate-setup/) for managing keyboard shortcuts, especially for moving applications around, but this has since been simplified by using [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) instead of Slate.

Spectacle has everything I need, especially [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle#keyboard-shortcuts) for maximising an application, of "flinging" it over to another display.

[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) is free and comes highly recommended, give it a try!
