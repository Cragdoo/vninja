  * [ReFS cluster size with Veeam Backup & Replication: 64KB or 4KB?](http://www.virtualtothecore.com/en/refs-cluster-size-with-veeam-backup-replication-64kb-or-4kb/?utm_content=bufferb8365&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
My friend [Luca](http://twitter.com/dellock6) has written a great article explaining how to determine the best cluster size for a ReFS based Veeam B&R repository.

    
  * [AWS for VMware Admins – London VMUG Slide Deck](http://tekhead.it/blog/2017/01/aws-vmware-admins-london-vmug-slide-deck/)
Great presentation by [Alex Galbraith](https://twitter.com/alexgalbraith) and [Chris Porter](https://twitter.com/uprightvinyl) from the London VMUG. Lots of useful information there for those well versed in the VMware universe, but curious on what AWS have to offer.

    
  * [Architecting a vSAN Cluster (part 1)
](https://francisdalyit.com/2016/12/19/architecting-a-vsan-cluster-part-1/)This first is the first in a series of posts (hopefully), and [Francis Daly](https://twitter.com/FrancisDaly) is off to a great start. Especially in regards to disk group design in a vSAN cluster.

    
  * [Designing vSAN Networks – Using Multiple Interfaces?
](https://blogs.vmware.com/virtualblocks/2017/01/18/designing-vsan-networks-using-multiple-interfaces/)Good primer on how you can, and should, configure multiple NICs for your vSAN traffic.

](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xzKuQEJKWY&feature=youtu.be&a)[Frank Denneman's](https://twitter.com/FrankDenneman) closing keynote from the Nordic VMUG 2016. No one, other than Frank, does a closing keynote wearing a Warriors hoodie.
