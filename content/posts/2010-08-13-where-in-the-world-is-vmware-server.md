![](/images/logos/vmware-logo.gif)Over at [PlanetVM](http://planetvm.net/)  [Wil van Antwerpen](http://twitter.com/wilva) posted [The Future of VMware Server](http://planetvm.net/blog/?p=1569) back in May 2010. Wil makes the argument that it seems like VMware is indeed abandoning VMware Server as a product, leaving us with VMware Workstation and VMware Player as the two Windows installable virtualization solutions from the company.

This has caused some reactions, including [my own comment](http://planetvm.net/blog/?p=1569&cpage=1#comment-2869), where I question the smartness of abandoning what might just be one of the best virtualization "gateway drugs" VMware has to offer.

In my opinion, abandoning VMware Server would be a  bad move, but re-reading the documentation from VMware and thinking more about the consequences this might have made me realize something;

**What if VMware is working on a replacement product or management solution?**

I seriously doubt VMware would want to abandon the use case that VMware Server has, even if they do indeed abandon the VMware Server product itself. I don't have any inside knowledge about this, but lets say that VMware is working on a management framework for VMware Player?

Something that you can install, in addition to VMware Player, that lets you set auto-start parameters for VMs, let them run headless and remotely manage them? _Wouldn't that pretty much allow us to do the same with VMware Player, that we today use VMware Server for?_ 

The more I think about it, the more it makes sense.
