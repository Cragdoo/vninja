The new pricing is very attractive, especially since you no longer need to buy access on a course by course basis.

The courses are delivered in your browser, but Trainsignal also offers an offline player in case you need access when traveling or otherwise offline.

Give it a test run today, by [signing up now (referral link)](https://www.trainsignal.com/Invite/5d22c5) you get three days full access for free.
