**In The Bag #4 - Week 47**



## Technology






    
  * **[Capacity Expansion & Disk Group Design Decisions–All Flash vSAN](http://www.virtuallanger.com/2016/11/22/capacity-expansion-disk-group-design-decisions-all-flash-vsan/)**
Every design decision has a consequence, and thats also the case when it comes to vSAN. [Jason Langer](https://twitter.com/jaslanger) has written a great article highlighting how enabling deduplication and compression has consequences for drive failure scenarios.

    
  * **[Veeam Backup & Replication and vSAN integration deep dive](http://www.virtualtothecore.com/en/veeam-backup-replication-and-vsan-integration-deep-dive/)**
Great deep dive by [Luca](https://twitter.com/dellock6) into how Veeam B&R integrates with vSAN and uses that tight integration to speed up backup and minimise network traffic in the process.

    
  * [**vGhetto Automated vSphere Lab Deployment for vSphere 6.0u2 & vSphere 6.5**
](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2016/11/vghetto-automated-vsphere-lab-deployment-for-vsphere-6-0u2-vsphere-6-5.html)[William](https://twitter.com/lamw) has yet again knocked it out of the park, this time by creating a PowerCLI script that rolls out nested ESXi environments with vSAN like there is no tomorrow. Much love for this; I've already run it a few times in my own lab environment.





## Other






    
  * **[The Fascinating Science Behind 'Talking' With Your Hands
](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/talking-with-hands-gestures_us_56afcfaae4b0b8d7c230414e)**I admit it, and everyone who has ever seen me do a presentation or talk can verify it, I'm a "hand-talker", and this is also why I hate using hand-held microphones. I forget, and move my hands around all over place.

    
  * **[Tiny Desk: how NPR’s intimate concert series earned a cult following](http://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/21/13550754/npr-tiny-desk-concert)**
There is something about live, not overproduced and raw music that appeals to me. The Tiny Desk recordings are fun, quirky and sometimes you can even spot that the artists gets it wrong. Great stuff. I particularly like the set played by [Death Cab for Cutie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6uRT7PxTQ).

    
  * [**The Most Influential Images of All Time**](http://100photos.time.com)
Time has created a list of what they think are the most influential images of all time, and it's a great one. A bunch of these are really interesting, both from an historic perspective, but also from a photography one.







## Special



This week I've decided to add a new section. This "Special" section will some times pop up, pretty randomly, if there is something in particular that caught my attention this week. Safe to say, this week there was.

[Lars Trøen](https://twitter.com/larstr), one of the longest "serving" vExperts, fellow Norwegian and all-around good guy recorded a video expressing his [undying love for VMware Workstation](http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2016/11/every-day-thanksgiving.html).

So here he is, in all his glory:

That's it for this week, a new one is in the works for next friday
