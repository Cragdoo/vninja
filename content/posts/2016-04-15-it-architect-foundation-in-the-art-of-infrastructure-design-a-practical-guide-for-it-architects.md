[![product_thumbnail.php](http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/product_thumbnail.php_.jpeg)](https://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?keyWords=arrasjid&type=)Way back in late 2014 I volunteered to do technical review for a book called **[IT Architect: Foundation in the Art of Infrastructure Design: A Practical Guide for IT Architects](https://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?keyWords=arrasjid&type=). **Due to a lot of unforeseen events, the book has been delayed quite a bit, but it's finally available as hardcopy, paperback and eBook! The book is written by **J****ohn Yani Arrasjid**, VCDX-001, **Mark Gabryjelski**, VCDX-023, **Chris McCain**, VCDX-079 and as the title states it really does lay out the foundation of how to approach infrastructure design in a modern virtualised data center.

I'm truly honoured to have had a small part in the creation of what I consider to be a must read for all existing and aspiring IT-architects! It highlights methodology, but it also contains design processes through case studies with concrete examples.

[Grab a copy](https://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?keyWords=arrasjid&type=) today, it's well worth both the money and the time spent reading it. I can guarantee that you won't only read this book once, you'll be going back through it several times as it is a treasure trove of real world experience that is hard to come by any other place.



_This is the first of a series of design books, so there are more goodies on the way!_
