[![bronze_vsphereland](http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bronze_vsphereland-e1468096666692.png)](http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bronze_vsphereland-e1468096666692.png)While I was away on a two week holiday on the Croatia's sunny Makarska Rivijera, [Eric Siebert](https://twitter.com/ericsiebert) announced the result of his annual [Top vBlog](http://vsphere-land.com/news/top-vblog-2016-full-results.html), and much to my surprise **vNinja** did quite the jump from last years 46th spot to this years 27th!  Honestly, I thought the site would drop out of the the top 50 list this year, but once again I'm proven to be mistaken. **Some times being wrong is just great!**

Not only that, but in the _Favorite Independent_ _Blogger_ category, I also did a small hop from 7th to 6th.

**Obviously this makes me very happy, and I wish to thank everyone who voted for the site this year. **

Also, if you happen to meet [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericsiebert) at VMworld, or anywhere else this year, buy the guy a beer. Or three. He like totally deserves it.
