[vSoup Episode #10](http://vsoup.net/2011/05/vsoup-raw-10/) is finally released, this time with [Stuart Radnidge](http://twitter.com/vinternals) ([blog](http://blog.vinternals.com/)) as our guest. This episode is a bit unusual, as we didn't really have a set agenda before starting the recording, so we jump around all of the place covering a pretty wide area of topics. Be sure to check it out!

[Tech Field Day #6](http://techfieldday.com/2011/tfd6/) is approaching really fast, in fact it's only a week away now! I will leave for Boston on Tuesday, June 7, for what looks to be a very, very busy but fun couple of days. I don't know what to expect, but [Chris Dearden ](https://twitter.com//ChrisDearden)has warned be that I probably won't be idle much.

This is the first Tech Field Day event that solely focuses on virtualization and the presenter list looks really promising:

In addition to these, there is a couple of more presenters that have not been announced yet. I've met a few of the other delegates before, but the majority of them will be new acquaintances! 

Since the entire vSoup crew is going across the pond, we'll try to get some live vSoup recordings done during the event! 

The delegates will also be attending the [VMunderground BPaaS (Beantown Party as a Service): Tech Field Day 6 Edition](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1716027685), so if  you are in Boston on Thursday 9th of June, be sure to get a ticket and stop by and say hi!
