Considering it's mid-january 2017 already, it's time to do my annual goal list for the new year.

# My goals for 2017:







  * **Get that [VCAP6-DCV Design](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=89133&ui=www_cert) exam out of the way** — I did the beta in march 2016, but missed the mark by a small margin.


  * **AWS Associate Certifications** — Not sure how many of the three exams I want to do yet, but I'm going to at least give the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam a go.


  * **Learn something new** — This ties into the previous goal a bit, but I will try to allocate time to learning something new every month. Some times it might be tech, some times it might be soft skills. I've purchased a few [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/) courses with this in mind already.


  * **Attend an industry conference** — Most likely VMworld Barcelona in September.


  * **Continue to build the SDDC practice at Proact** — The foundations laid in 2016 were awesome. 2017 is the year we have to start executing and delivering on it.


  * **vNinja.net** — Keep posting whenever I feel like it, but try to keep the "[In the Bag](http://vninja.net/in-the-bag/)"-series going.


  * **Photography** — Take up photography as a hobby again, I've been quiet on that front for quite a while and I miss the creative outlet it provides. With upcoming trips to Liverpool (Liverpool FC vs Arsenal) in march, [Radiohead](https://www.wasteheadquarters.com/schedule) concert in Oslo in June, and the [Secret Solstice](http://secretsolstice.is) festival on Iceland also in June, there should be plenty of opportunities in 2017.



I also have a few other personal goals for 2017 that are not listed here, but I'll keep myself accountable for those as well. Some of them were posted in my [2016 review post](http://vninja.net/misc/evaluating-2016/):





  * **I need to get better at planning things out**, not just adding a todo item and think that somehow magically makes you more productive. Having a lot of todo items doesn't really help, unless you plan out how to accomplish them. This is one thing I aim on improving in 2017; _breaking bigger tasks into smaller ones to make them manageable and attainable_.


  * **Clearer focus.** This is a continuation of the previous point, but must get better at channeling energy into the tasks at hand, not on everything all at once. Set up time slots, and **use** them.


  * **Get more sleep.** I sleep way to little, and that needs to change drastically.



_So, bring it on 2017. I **think** I'm ready for my closeup now._
