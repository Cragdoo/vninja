Everyone, and probably their extended family including their mother-in-law, has heard me [whine and complain](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vcp-5-certification-requirement-clarification/) about the [VCP](www.vmware.com/go/vcp) training requirements.

VMware has unveiled a new lab, namely [Project Nee](http://labs.vmware.com/nee/) (Next-Generation Education Environment)

and this is something I´m _really_ excited about.

Project Nee is described as this:


<blockquote>VMware Project NEE is a new VMware Labs project providing a richly featured, powerful online learning and lab environment delivered from the cloud to any device, anywhere, anytime.</blockquote>


There aren´t many details available at the moment, except that this seems to be exactly what I have looked for from VMware;
**Online access to a virtual lab environment, where you can access training resources in a flexible manner. Self paced online training, without the need to spend days on end in a classroom.**

In fact, the site specifically mentions “_VMware vSphere: Install, Configure, Manage_” training as being specifically beta tested at the moment.

There is no information on pricing and availability just yet, but with [VMworld Europe](http://vmworld.com) only a week away I would not be surprised if something is to be announced in Barcelona.

With the VMware Hands-On Labs going public some time soon, and now Project Nee, VMware is certainly heading in the right direction as far as lab access and training is concerned.
