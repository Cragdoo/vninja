[vSoup Episode #7 "Everything is better with Bacon"](http://vsoup.net/2011/03/vsoup-everything-is-better-with-bacon-7/) is now available for your listening "pleasure". With [Sean Clark](http://twitter.com/vseanclark) as our guest, we get into quite a few topics like storage and SQL virtualization. Be sure to check it out!

In related news, VMware has created a [Virtualization Podcast directory](http://communities.vmware.com/groups/podcasts?view=discussions&start=0) over on the VMware Communities portal. Way to go [John](http://twitter.com/jtroyer), hopefully the other podcasts will follow suite so we can have one common directory for all of us!
