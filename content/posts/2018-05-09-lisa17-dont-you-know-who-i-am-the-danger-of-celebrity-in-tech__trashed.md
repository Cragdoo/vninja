This is the second recorded talk published in the [Awesome Talks](http://vninja.net/awesome-talks/) series. This time it's [Scott Hanselman's](https://www.hanselman.com/) "**It's not what you read, it's what you ignore**" talk from Dev Day in Kraków way back in 2012.

**So here is the first one!**

John Nicholson [shared](https://twitter.com/lost_signal/status/933291400996700160) this awesome talk by [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/@QuinnyPig) from [LISA17](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17), which should be **mandatory** for anyone attending conferences, or talks in general. Not only does it dive into the culture of asking questions when attending a talk, but also has lots of good information for speakers as well. Trust me, this is ~44 minutes very well spent.
