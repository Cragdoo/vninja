![VMworld 2013 Logo](http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1.jpg)For the first time since 2010 I will actually be physically attending VMworld Europe! I fly over from the very cold, rainy and generally very autumny Norway to sunny Barcelona on Sunday the 13th.

Based on my past experience from VMworld in Copenhagen, I have decided to go easy on the session scheduling and not fill my calendar to the brim.

Sure, the sessions provide insane amounts of useful content, but for me the main reason to attend VMworld is to physically meet up and talk to a lot of the people I usually spend a lot of time communicating with. **The social aspect, also called the hallway track, is to me the most valuable aspect of attending.** After all, the sessions are recorded and available post-conference anyway.

So, expect to find me in the hangspace and community lounge for the most part. Odds are you might find me at a party or two as well...

_If you see me, please stop and say hi! _

I will also be a part of the [vBrownbag TechTalks](http://professionalvmware.com/2013/10/vbrownbag-techtalks-schedule-for-vmworld-emea-2013/) when we do a [APAC Virtualization Podcast](http://apacvirtual.com) / [vSoup](http://vSoup.net) crossover live recording. I'm really looking forward to that, should be some good fun!

Oh, and I´ll be a part of the vExpert Daily slot on Wednesday the 16th.

I might also be doing a vBrownbag TechTalk of my own as well, but the jury is still out on that one...
