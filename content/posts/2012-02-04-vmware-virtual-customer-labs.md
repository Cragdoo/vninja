I´ve mentioned this earlier, [VMware hands-in labs going public in 2012](http://vninja.net/virtualization/vmworld-hands-on-labs-going-public-in-2012/), but finally it seems like something is happening in that regard!

[Scott Sauer](http://twitter.com/ssauer) has announced the availability of ["VMware Virtual Customer Labs” (vCL)](http://www.virtualinsanity.com/index.php/2012/02/04/vmware-virtual-customer-labs-are-live-hands-on-walk-through/) where he walks us through the setup and delivery of the new vCL offering.

At the moment it´s only available to "selected customers", supported by a VMware pre-sales engineer, and the number of labs are limited. It´s still a work in progress, and I´m sure great things will come out of this!

Now, how do I get access to it as a partner? Also, I wonder what possibilities that lies in this with regards to [alternative VCP requirements](http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vcp-5-certification-requirement-clarification/)?
