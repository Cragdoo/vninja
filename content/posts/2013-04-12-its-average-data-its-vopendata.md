As we all (should) know, that is very much a trick question.

Now, consider this little non-trick question:


<blockquote>I wonder what the avg disk size is for your virtual machine these days. I do most math with 60GB on avg, but wonder if that has changed

And now, guess what? Just 16 days later, a brand new data mining tool has emerged based on that initial question.


[vOpenData](http://www.vopendata.org) is now live, in an attempt to answer these kinds of questions.

_Simplistically put, this site gathers anonymous [data](http://www.vopendata.org/pages/data_faq) from your virtual infrastructure and puts it into a global dataset ready for analysis and presentation._

As data is contributed from various sources, the [public dashboard](http://dash.vopendata.org/public) is updated.

Another great community driven resource is born, this time by [Ben Thomas](https://twitter.com/wazoo) and [William Lam](https://twitter.com/lamw).
