VMware has opened the public voting for the [VMworld 2011 sessions](http://www.vmworld.com/cfp.jspa). Personally I haven't submitted anything, but I do see a lot of familiar names in the voting application.

The voting is available to anyone who has a [vmworld.com](http://vmworld.com) account, and the voting period is from May 9th to May 18th. The voting is global, which means a vote for a session counts as a vote for both VMworld US and VMworld EMEA as 80% of the selected sessions will occur at both events. You can vote on as many sessions as you like, but only one vote pr. session.

There is a plethora of sessions, in fact there are 854 sessions to choose between! Thankfully VMware has included a search application that enables you to focus on your particular areas of interest and find sessions that fit.

I've done my part and voted, and I must say that some of these sessions sound great! Some of the session submitters have done a very good job with titling their submissions, which certainly helps in identifying what sessions to vote on. I won't go through my entire list of votes, but a couple of sessions caught my eye immediately:

Goes to show that titling your submission properly really does make a difference.
