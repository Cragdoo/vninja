Finally. I've finally found a way to put two of my favourite things together in a completely non-sensical way, namely VMware Marvin and Pearl Jam. As [The Register reported earlier today](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/20/vmware_seeks_two_new_hardwarerelated_trademarks/?mt=1408660085798), odds are that Marvin no longer responds to it's project name, but rather to the new EVO name recently trademarked by VMware. There has been whispers of a Marvin name change for quite some time, so this isn't really hard to believe.

I have also found three new Twitter accounts, which at the time of discovery only followed one other account namely [@vmware](http://twitter.com/vmware):




    
  * [vmw evo rail](http://twitter.com/vmwevorail)

    
  * [vmw evo rack](http://twitter.com/vmwevorack)

    
  * [vmw evo rackscale](http://twitter.com/vmwevorackscale)



So bring on Monday, this thing will be huge if it is what I think it is. And I think that it is. I think.

So how does this tie in with Pearl Jam?
