A little over a month ago I announced the [Want to Win a Google Chromecast](http://vninja.net/news/win-google-chromecast/)  contest and finally the winner has been selected. Since there was a grand total of 5 submissions, and one of them was immediately disqualified for a distinct lack of Ninja-presence, I decided to just do a random draw.

The submitted photos were numbered by the order they appeared in on my post as I took this screenshot. I then put the number range 1 to 4 into [random.org](http://random.org) and recorded the output

By random selection, the winning submission is **Ninja with Entourage** submitted by **Chad Singleton**.

_Congratulations! Please contact me for shipping details, and I'll get the Chromecast sponsored by Veeam shipped in your direction as soon as possible! _
