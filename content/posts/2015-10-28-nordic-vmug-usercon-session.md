VMUG Denmark is arranging the [Nordic VMUG UserCon](https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=10926) in Copenhagen December 1st 2015, and the [agenda](https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=10931) went live earlier today. I'm definitely going to be there, and as it turns out I even have my own session lined up:



* * *



**Session Title:
**VCS to VCVA Converter or how a fling can be good for you!
**
Session Abstract:
**Migrating from Windows vCenter to the VCVA? No worries, the VMware VCS to VCVA Converter fling has you covered! Learn how to migrate your existing configuration to the vCenter Virtual Appliance. We’ll cover both best practices and caveats from real world experiences with the tool!

I hope to see all of you there, and perhaps some of you will even pop into my session. I'm certain that "**Getting back to my roots – a look at vSphere Core Storage Enhancements! - Cormac Hogan, VMware**" and "**vRealize Orchestrator – The missing “Getting Started” session - Joerg Loew, VMware**" will draw the biggest crowds in my time slot though (Which is arguably a good thing).

VMUG Denmark has really put together a great looking agenda, with additional speakers like Paul Strong, Duncan Epping,  Paudie O'Riordan and William Lam to mention a few. I'm also really looking forward to the closing keynote "**The Cloud and Beyond**" by [Andreas Mogensen](http://andreasmogensen.esa.int) of the ESA.

So, if you have the chance, book a trip to Copenhagen and lets meet up for a beer at the closing reception at the Nordic VMUG UserCon, see you there!
