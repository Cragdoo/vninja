  <p>Yesterday was my first real day as a_ Senior Solutions Architect_ for <a href="http://proact.no">Proact</a>, and today I flew to Oslo for on-boarding and some face-to-face time with my new colleagues over there. By the looks of it, there is a lot of exciting things in the pipeline, and it we land the things we have started on this should be interesting. Very interesting indeed.</p>

<p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/veeam_vanguard-300x96.png" alt="veeam_vanguard" />In addition to the excitement around changing employers, and roles, some other things have also
happened. Firstly, Veeam decided to award me the <a href="https://www.veeam.com/vanguard.html">Veeam Vanguard</a> title for 2016. I had the honour of being one of the inaugural members of this group in 2015, and I&rsquo;m very happy to be included in the group once more.</p>

<p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VMW-LGO-VMW-EUC-CHAMPION-WHT-2016-300x165.png" alt="" />Secondly, VMware has announced the list of their <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2016/04/announcing-our-2016-end-user-computing-euc-champions.html">EUC Champions for 2016</a>. This program had a &ldquo;soft-launch&rdquo; in 2015, but has now gone official in 2016. I&rsquo;m extremely honoured to extend my membership in this small group in 2016.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a few days ago <a href="http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/vmug/compass_vol2issue1/">Issue 1, 2016, of VMUG Compass</a> was published &ndash; and that includes an interview with me as well.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s been quite a week so far, and it&rsquo;s only Tuesday. Now, I need to go lay down for a bit&hellip;</em></p>
