  <p>Keeping up with tradition (you thought I was going to say Kardashians there, didn&rsquo;t you?), it&rsquo;s time to evaluate 2017.</p>

<p>My list of <a href="http://vninja.net/misc/2017-you-better-deliver/">goals for 2017</a> and the verdict is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>**Get that <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=89133&amp;ui=www_cert">VCAP6-DCV Design</a> exam out of the way
**Done and dusted (for 6.5 that is, not 6.0). I&rsquo;ve also updated my VCP to 6.5, and I&rsquo;m currently waiting for the VCAP6.5-DCV Deploy exam.
*<strong><em>Score: <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></em></strong>*</p></li>

<li><p>**AWS Associate Certifications
**Didn&rsquo;t happen. Haven&rsquo;t done any of these, nor really studied for any of them (yet). Other certifications or time sinks have completely eradicated these.
*<strong><em>Score: 0/10</em></strong>*</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Learn something new</strong>
This one is hard to gauge, but 2017 has definitely been a learning experience in many ways. Not all that much tangible and measurable items here, bit I&rsquo;ll still rate it as medium. This category needs to be easier to assess for 2017.
*<strong><em>Score: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></em></strong>*</p></li>

<li><p>**Attend an industry conference
**VMworld 2017 in Barcelona was awesome, as I expected.
*<strong><em>Score: <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></em></strong>*</p></li>

<li><p>**vNinja.net
**Well, the In The Bag series didn&rsquo;t last that long, which was one of the main goals. I have kept posting whenever I feel like it, without any pressure, and in total I&rsquo;ve posted more in 2017 than I did in 2016. I have a theory as to why there isn&rsquo;t as much technical VMware posts though, but I&rsquo;ll keep that as a separate post for later. All in all, not bad.
*<strong><em>Score: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></em></strong>*</p></li>

<li><p>**Photography
**I&rsquo;m still not really happy with the amount of photography done in 2017, but I&rsquo;m really happy with a few of the shots I did manage to take and publish. Huge improvement from 2016.
*<strong><em>Score: <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></em></strong>*</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As far as my more &ldquo;soft&rdquo; goals for 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>I need to get better at planning things out — </strong>I think I&rsquo;ve managed to do this, to a degree. I&rsquo;ve become much better at breaking larger tasks into smaller ones, and follow them through. Productivity is always an ongoing process, but I notice that compared to many I interact with, I seem to have a better grasp of the tasks I need to complete, and don&rsquo;t forget nearly as much as I used to do. It&rsquo;s an ongoing process, but I&rsquo;m definitely moving in the right direction.</p></li>

<li><p>**Clearer focus — **Close correlation to the point above, but I&rsquo;ve improved in this area as well.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Get more sleep — </strong>I still sleep less than I think I should, but it&rsquo;s better than it has been for years.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all that gives me a personal score of 38 of a possible 60. Not quite what I wanted, but it&rsquo;s an improvement of the 28 rating for 2016. One of the major categories did get a 0/10, which really puts a dent in the score. I should have put in a general certification category instead, that would have helped bring the score up as I did a few ones I didn&rsquo;t plan on initially.</p>

<p>All in all, 2017 has been pretty good both professionally and personally. Now it&rsquo;s time to breathe, relax and make sure 2018 will be even better.</p>
