<p>After close to a full day of Twitter speculations and discussions on what <a href="http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmwares-mystic-marvin-project/">Marvin really is</a>, some thoughts kept stuck with me, and this is my attempt at articulating what I think VMware might be up to.</p>

<p>_Please note that I have no real knowledge of the status of the project, nor if it really exists outside of a poster in a window in the VMware campus. All I do know is that there is a <a href="http://trademarks.justia.com/861/60/marvin-86160864.html">trademark registered</a>, and that there seems to be some merit behind the speculations done by <a href="30/project-mystics-potential-competitors-to-vmware-bring-it-on.htm">CRN</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/19/emc_sailing_up_the_mystic_river/">The Register</a>._</p>

<p>There is one little tidbit in the trademark registration that has caused more than a few people to raise their eyebrows:</p>

<blockquote>Computer hardware for virtualization; computer hardware enabling users to manage virtual computing resources that include networking and data storage</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, it mentions hardware! Does that mean that VMware is going to start building their own hardware, or OEM it from someone? I really don&rsquo;t think that is the case. As far as I can gather, Marvin is more than a single physical hyper-converged hardware platform, with known VMware bits on top, sprinkled with some new management interface. Pinning this appliance model to a single vendor, like <a href="http://nutanix.com">Nutanix</a> does with their <a href="http://download.nutanix.com/guides/c_3_5/xhtml/oxy_ex-1/topics/hardware/system_specifications_nx7000_r.html">Super Micro chassis and components</a>, is not how VMware usually operates. I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s part of VMware&rsquo;s DNA to limit Marvin to a single hardware vendor, even if EMC is their biggest stock holder. I think the key here is to think of <strong>Marvin as a standard for building hyper-converged solutions</strong>. Build nodes to spec, and VMware will certify them for Marvin. Imagine that? You can probably mix and match nodes from different vendors, in the same &ldquo;MarvinMatrix&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2014/03/virtual-san-ready-nodes-cisco-dell-fujitsu-ibm-super-micro-next-30-days.html">VSAN Ready Nodes</a>, why not build <strong>Marvin Ready Nodes</strong> (for some reason I think VMware marketing might just come up with a better term come launch time&hellip;). Dell and Super Micro seem likely candidates, but how about Intel nodes? I am fairly sure that there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger">people</a> within VMware, and <a href="http://emcfederation.com">The Federation</a>, that has pretty good ties in that direction.</p>

<p>The possibilities here are pretty awesome, just like they are with existing hyper-converged solutions. Need more compute? Stick in another node into your network &ldquo;matrix&rdquo;, import it and it auto-configures itself based on whatever policy you have active. Need more storage, well, do the same thing. Add a new node, or just stick in a few more flash or hard drives into your existing chassis.</p>

<p>We all know this is going to be based on vSphere and VSAN, but there are other components that are yet left open for speculation:</p>

<p><strong>What about networking?</strong> We know VMware is pushing NSX, and we know they are working on making a smaller scale installation easier to implement. Given the time-frame we are looking at, namely next summer (read VMworld), I doubt that NSX will be a part of the first revision. Perhaps it&rsquo;s going to be <a href="http://www.arista.com/en/">Arista</a> at that point?</p>

<p>The second thing is the magic sauce that will tie everything together, and I have a feeling that this is where VMware&rsquo;s Marvin team members is really focusing its attention these days.  A solution like this, if my speculations are right, really needs a good management solution if it is to really deliver on what it seems to promise, namely a Software Defined Data Center, in a box. Or two boxes, for redundancy of course, or given VMware&rsquo;s normal reliance on N+1, it&rsquo;s probably best if you buy three of them to begin with.</p>
