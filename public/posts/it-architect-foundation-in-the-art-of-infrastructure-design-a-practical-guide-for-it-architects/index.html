The book is written by </strong>J**<strong>ohn Yani Arrasjid</strong>, VCDX-001, <strong>Mark Gabryjelski</strong>, VCDX-023, <strong>Chris McCain</strong>, VCDX-079 and as the title states it really does lay out the foundation of how to approach infrastructure design in a modern virtualised data center.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m truly honoured to have had a small part in the creation of what I consider to be a must read for all existing and aspiring IT-architects! It highlights methodology, but it also contains design processes through case studies with concrete examples.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?keyWords=arrasjid&amp;type=">Grab a copy</a> today, it&rsquo;s well worth both the money and the time spent reading it. I can guarantee that you won&rsquo;t only read this book once, you&rsquo;ll be going back through it several times as it is a treasure trove of real world experience that is hard to come by any other place.</p>

<p><em>This is the first of a series of design books, so there are more goodies on the way!</em></p>
