<p>I have given the site a small facelift, replacing the old theme with a new and cleaner version. For some reason, I get this &ldquo;theme itch&rdquo; a couple of times a year, but usually I manage to let it pass without doing many changes.</p>

<p>This time it stuck with me though, and ended up with replacing the old theme with a new one. In fact, the old theme had been active for close to two years now, so it was time to shake things up a bit any way. The new theme gives the site a fresh and in my opinion better look. The double menus in the header makes it look more organised, and less cluttered and the static navigation header is something I&rsquo;ve wanted to have for a long time now.</p>

<p>It just looks simpler and cleaner, especially with regards to font faces and sizes.</p>
