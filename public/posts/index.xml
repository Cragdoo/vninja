      <description>Like Sam and Simon over at definit.co.uk I&amp;rsquo;ve done a quick GDPR-related overhaul of the site.
Like the two English scholars and gentlemen, I&amp;rsquo;ve created the required Privacy Policy page. I&amp;rsquo;ve also deleted all existing comments on the site, and disabled comments sitewide — hopefully that&amp;rsquo;s enough.
Oh, joy.</description>

      <description>If you boot your ESXi hosts from SD-cards or USB you might have run into this issue. Suddenly your host(s) displays the following under events: &amp;ldquo;Bootbank cannot be found at path ‘/bootbank’.&amp;rdquo;
Usually this means that the boot device has been corrupted somehow, either due to a device failure or other issues. Normally the host continues to run, until it&amp;rsquo;s rebooted that is&amp;hellip;
For some reason, vRealize Operations doesn&amp;rsquo;t pick this up as a host issue that it alerts on, so if your alerting regime is based on vROps alerts, you might not get alerted immediately.</description>

Before you start on this rather long post, have a go at part #1:
tl;dr This is a long read. To get to the juicy part on how Intel potentially shipped pre-release microcode to partners, skip to section 3. The short, short version is that the official Intel microcode update contains newer microcode for Skylake-SP and Kaby Lake/Coffe Lake than what currently is shipping from VMware/HPE/DellEMC etc.</description>

Disclaimer: This is a report based on current development as of 7. January, the situation is changing by the hour so read this opinion piece with that in hindsight.
Unless you have been living under a rock for the last week you will know by now that there is a universal design flaw in most modern microprocessors, leaving them vulnerable to a serious information disclosure problem that requires updates to all operating systems and processors.</description>

      <description>Keeping up with tradition (you thought I was going to say Kardashians there, didn&amp;rsquo;t you?), it&amp;rsquo;s time to evaluate 2017.
My list of goals for 2017 and the verdict is as follows:
 **Get that VCAP6-DCV Design exam out of the way **Done and dusted (for 6.5 that is, not 6.0). I&amp;rsquo;ve also updated my VCP to 6.5, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently waiting for the VCAP6.5-DCV Deploy exam. *Score: 10&amp;frasl;10*

      <description>This is the second recorded talk published in the Awesome Talks series. This time it&amp;rsquo;s Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rdquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not what you read, it&amp;rsquo;s what you ignore&amp;rdquo; talk from Dev Day in Kraków way back in 2012.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a technical talk, it&amp;rsquo;s originally geared towards developers but Scott&amp;rsquo;s message should resonate with everyone in the tech field. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s about how you can deal with large amounts of information. Lot&amp;rsquo;s of great takeaways here!</description>

Simply put, this little gem let&amp;rsquo;s you hide any or all menu bar icons in macOS, while still keeping them easily accessible behind a small arrow:

      <description>When playing around with Royal TSX I needed to mass convert the VMware Clarity .svg files to .png files that I could use as icons in Royal TSX.
After trying a series of different approaches, I ended up with using rsvg-convert from libRSVG. In order to get rsvg-convert installed on my MacBook, I turned to HomeBrew.
HomeBrew, which calls itself The missing package manager for macOS is in my opinion essential for any macOS user.</description>

      <description>Myles Gray asked me how I integrate Pocket with Todoist, after my How I use Todoist post, and the answer is very simple: IFTTT. If-This-Then-That lets you connect services, and create rules (or applets) that trigger based on events in those services, luckily both Todoist and Pocket are supported.
Now, there is a bit of overlap between how I use Pocket and Todoist, but I mainly use Pocket to keep track of links I want to either read later, or use as basis for blog posts.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, I use Todoist to keep track of my personal to-do list. This is the first to-do manager I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to stick with, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it daily for well over 2 years now. In that two year period I&amp;rsquo;ve reorganised it a bit, but for the most part I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep to the main structure I initially created when setting it up the first time.</description>

      <description>For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Royal TSX is an awesome Remote Management solution, which supports RDP, VNC, SSH, S/FTP and even ESXi and vCenter. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for years, not just because they offer free licenses for vExperts (and others), but simply because it works really well. Store it&amp;rsquo;s config file on a synchronized file area (like Dropbox), and boom, your config follows you around from machine to machine, including custom icons.</description>

      <description>In the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an uptick in spoofed emails being sent with my own personal email domain. Not only is this extremely annoying, but more problematic is that recipients receive spam and phishing emails from what seems to be my personal mail account, simply by spoofing the from address. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why domain and email address has been &amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;rdquo; for this, but I guess this is fallout from the LinkedIn breach way back in 2012.</description>

      <description>VMware has just announced vSAN v6.6, with over 20 new features. While new and shiny features are nice I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight a couple that I think might be undervalued from release feature-set perspective, but highly valuable in day to day operations of a vSAN environment, otherwise known as Day 2 operations.
vSAN Configuration Assist is one such new feature. While it&amp;rsquo;s true that it helps first time configuration of a greenfield installation with vSAN (no more bootstrapping, yay!</description>

The Fling is listed with the following requirements:

Just a quick post about something I experienced at a client, with ESXi 6.0 hosts, today:
If you have trouble performing VMware snapshots, and see a msg.snapshot.error-QUIESCINGERROR error, check the host time settings and NTP.
In this case, snapshots of VMs located on other hosts in the cluster were fine, but once a VM was moved to the new host, snapshot operations failed after an hour or so.</description>

      <description>Working with the keyboard to move resize, focus and arrange your applications is a great productivity tip. When I changed from Windows to macOS a few years ago, I had a pretty convoluted setup based on Slate for managing keyboard shortcuts, especially for moving applications around, but this has since been simplified by using Spectacle instead of Slate.
Spectacle has everything I need, especially keyboard shortcuts for maximising an application, of &amp;ldquo;flinging&amp;rdquo; it over to another display.</description>

This time it stuck with me though, and ended up with replacing the old theme with a new one. In fact, the old theme had been active for close to two years now, so it was time to shake things up a bit any way.</description>

Back in March 2016 VMware announced that everyone with a valid VMware vCenter license are also entitled to 25-OSI pack of vRealize Log Insight for vCenter Server. This means that you can gather logs for up to 25 ESXi hosts, VMs or other devices, in your environment.</description>

For those unaware of their offering entails, it&amp;rsquo;s simply put a solution for managing secondary storage. In this case, secondary storage is really everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t mission critical. It can be your backups, test/dev workloads, file shares and so on . The idea to place these unstructured data sets on a secondary storage platform, to ease management and analytics but at the same time keep it integrated with the rest of the existing environment.</description>

      <description>Now that the seasons have changed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at 2017 and start planning the year. First up, when is VMworld 2017, and perhaps most importantly where? There has been a lot of speculation about this, and the perhaps strongest rumour was that it was moving to Berlin.
The details for the US has already been posted on vmworld.com, but for Europe all it says is &amp;ldquo;Fall&amp;rdquo;.
According to Duncan, which usually is in the know, VMworld Europe 2017 will once again be in Barcelona, but in September instead of October.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fleshing out a properVeeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication Demo lab at work, but doing demos on static VMs isn&amp;rsquo;t all that much fun and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give us much. Doing scheduled backups of non-changing data is really boring.
So, in order to get some changes done on the file system on a few Linux VMs running in the environment, I came up with the following solution:
I set up a crontab entry that generates a file with random data in it a couple of times a day, just to make sure that there are some changes made to the VM.</description>

      <description>A while ago I decided to try and gather a bunch of non-public information in an easy to write and consume fashion. After a bit of fiddling, and testing different potential solutions, GitBook emerged as the best option. By using MarkDown as the markup language, it’s both cross-platform and easy to manage, as the content is nothing but raw text files.
GitBook is awesome, no question about it, but in this case I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the content hosted publicly on gitbook.</description>

I have a couple of other ideas as well, so I might make a few more, but I&amp;rsquo;ll wait until vSphere 6.5 is released in case the formats and paths change again. After all the new VCSA is based on VMware Photon, so things might just moved around a bit.</description>

This program logs both which IP addresses are doing the attempts, and which passwords they are using.</description>

Besides the general announcements around vSphere 6.5 and surrounding products, the next big thing might just be Cross-Cloud Architecture and of course VMware Cloud on AWS. The announcements around vSAN 6.5 (yes, it is now vSAN and not Virtual SAN/VSAN anymore), are also very interesting. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time I revisit my earlier VMware VSAN; More than meets the eye post and update it for vSAN 6.</description>

      <description>Did you know that Dell has a bootable linux ISO with firmware upgrades for their servers available? Neither did I, but luckily I found it today when needing it at a customer site.
Check out Updating Dell PowerEdge servers via bootable media / ISO where you can download bootable ISOs for specific server models, and get all your firmware upgraded in one fell swoop.
Be warned though, it takes quite some time to run though it all (125 update packages in this instance), but it sure beats installing manually or creating your own bootable ISO with the Dell Repository Manager or even using Dell Server Update Utility.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Slack to alert and log a few things in my environment, and one of the things I use it for is to alert me if someone logs on via SSH to my public facing Jumphost.
For a good walkthrough on how to set up such a host, check out Tunnel all your remote connections through ssh with a linux jumpbox by Luca Dell&amp;rsquo;Oca.
My Ubuntu 16.04 Jumphost is set up to only accept Key-Based Authentication, to secure it as much as possible, but I would still like to get instant notification if someone logs into it interactively.</description>

      <description>Just like Lior Kamrat I&amp;rsquo;ve set up my own private Slack for messaging and alerting from various services running both in my lab and some external facing services. It&amp;rsquo;s only been running a few days, but so far it works brilliantly and helps me keep track.
So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up Slack alerting and/or integrations for the following items:

      <description>VMworld Europe is just a couple of weeks away now, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to spend a week in sunny Barcelona. Last year my trip got cancelled in the last minute, but that will not be the case this year.
As usual I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to a bunch of sessions, and general announcements, but for me the value of attending VMworld is in the networking with other people. Sessions and keynotes can be reviewed later, interacting with others can not.</description>

      <description>As we all know by now, PernixData was gobbled up by Nutanix a while back, and since then there has been a nothing but silence on the future of the FVP and Architect products. Now it seems it&amp;rsquo;s over. The acquisition trigged a bunch of PernixData employees moving elsewhere, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the products time to move on as well.
From what I&amp;rsquo;m hearing, End of Sale and End of Life for both products are due to be announced soon.</description>

      <guid>/homelab/cloudflare-dynamic-dns-update-script-cf-ddns-sh/</guid>
      <description>As a part of myHomelab project, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a proper bash script to provide dynamic DNS updates for external resources, via CloudFlare. More details on the reasoning behind it can be found in Using CloudFlare for Dynamic DNS, but since that was posted I&amp;rsquo;ve fleshed the script out quite a bit more.
The new and updated script can be found on GitHub: cf-ddns.sh. It now writes events to syslog when it runs, so you can use VMware Log Insight (or another log solution) to capture the events, and use it to track public IP changes if you want.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I tried to lay out the foundation and reasoning behind requiring a Dynamic DNS Service, and here is how I solved it using CloudFlare.
First of all, I moved my chosen domain name to CloudFlare, and made sure everything resolved ok with static records. Once that was working, I started playing around with the CloudFlare API, using Cocoa Rest Client. I&amp;rsquo;m no developer (as is probably very apparent by the script below), nor API wizard of any kind, but it was fairly easy figuring out how to craft a request that lists my DNS zone.</description>

      <description>While working on my new Homelab setup, I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating ways to provide hostname based access to several web services located in my DMZ zone. Since my provider doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide static IP addresses, I also need an external Dynamic DNS service, to provide said hostname mappings through the reverse proxy on the inside.
There are loads of Dynamic DNS services available, most of them lets you use some sort of predefined domain name scheme, and point it to your external IP, but I wanted to use a domain name that I own and control.</description>

Naturally, when there is a new vCenter instance, all the Virtual Machine Managed Object Reference&amp;rsquo;s (MoRef) change, which makes Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication start a new backup/replication chain, since all VMs are treated as new ones.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I decided to go full-on mad scientist in documenting my new home lab / network setup, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even created a GitHub repository for it.
The idea is to create a framework for developing this kind of documentation, heavily influenced by the VCDX methodology and framework. Over time, Conceptual, Logical and Physical designs will be added, as well as configuration settings and operational procedures. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll also contain some useful diagrams.</description>

      <description>A little while ago William Lam published a little python script called extract_vsphere_deployment_topology.py that basically lets you export your current vSphere PSC topology as a DOT (graph description language) file. Great stuff, and in itself useful as is, especially if you run it through webgraphviz.com as William suggests.
The thing is, you might want to edit the topology map, change colours and fonts, and even move the boxes around, after you get the output.</description>

Due to a lot of unforeseen events, the book has been delayed quite a bit, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally available as hardcopy, paperback and eBook! The book is written by J**ohn Yani Arrasjid, VCDX-001, Mark Gabryjelski, VCDX-023, Chris McCain, VCDX-079 and as the title states it really does lay out the foundation of how to approach infrastructure design in a modern virtualised data center.</description>

      <description>I recently set up a VMware Virtual SAN 6.1 Proof-of-Concept for a customer, configuring a 3-node cluster based on the following setup:
Hardware:  HP ProLiant DL380 G9
 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2680 @ 2.50Ghz w/12 Cores
 392 GB RAM
 1 x Intel DC 3700 800GB NVMe
 6 x Intel DC S3610 1.4TB SSD
 HP FlexFabric 556FLR-SFP+ 10GBe NICs
  Virtual SAN Setup: Since this was a simple PoC setup, the VSAN was configured with 1 disk group pr host with all 6 Intel DC S3610 drives used as the capacity layer, and the Intel DC P3700 NVMe cards set up as the cache.</description>

      <description>For some time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been advocating the usage of VCSA instead of the traditional Microsoft Windows based vCenter. It has feature parity with the Windows version now, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to deploy, gets right-sized out of the box and eliminates the need for an external Microsoft SQL server.
One of the questions I often face when talking about the appliance,_ is how do we handle backups?_ Most customers are comfortable with backup up Windows servers and Microsoft SQL, but quite a few have reservations when it comes to the integrated vPostgres database that the VCSA employs.</description>

So, how did I do?  Master Markdown: I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that most of the writing I&amp;rsquo;ve done in 2015 has been done in Markdown. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really moved on to really create Markdown based documentation and convert it like I intended, but still, Markdown has become second nature in 2015.</description>

      <description>Dockerflix is a nice little project that allows you to route your Netflix (and other various streaming services) through a SNI Proxy to access content otherwise geo-blocked. Of course, this requires that you have a VM with for instance an US IP to provide the breakout network, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Ravello Systems comes into the equation. Luckily as a current vExpert I have access to 1000 free monthly CPU hours of personal/lab usage, all with a choice of regions to put the VM in.</description>

      <description>Way back in 2014 I wrote a piece called VSAN – The Unspoken Future, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time it got a revision. Of course, lots of things have happened to VSAN since then and even more is on the way, but I think there is more to this than adding features like erasure coding, deduplication and compression. All of these are important features, and frankly they need to be in a product that aims a lot higher than you might think.</description>

After some serious head scratching, it dawned on me after checking the DNS records for the DC in the domain, from the vCenter Appliance itself:
[cc lang=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;100%&amp;rdquo; theme=&amp;ldquo;blackboard&amp;rdquo; nowrap=&amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;] dig +noall +answer +search dc1.esod.local dc1.esod.local. 3600 IN A 10.0.1.201 [/cc]

      <description>As a few of you have noticed, I recently changed my title on LinkedIn from Chief Consultant to Cloud Architect in the newly formed EVRY Cloud Consulting division, but what does that mean and perhaps more importantly, why?
The closest description I have found to describe what my new role is this:
 Leads in the development of the technical solution or offering, in translating the business needs into technical requirements.</description>

      <description>During an upgrade from vSphere 5.1 to 5.5, I ran into a rather strange issue when trying to utilize VMware Update Manager to perform the ESXi upgrade.
During scanning, VUM reported the ESXi host as &amp;ldquo;Incompatible&amp;rdquo;, without offering any other explanation. I spent ages looking through VUM logs, trying to find the culprit, suspecting it was an incompatible VIB. Without finding anything that gave me any indication on what the problem might be, I moved on to looking at the ESXi image I had imported into VUM.</description>

Since I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my day in esxcli, here is a quick post on how to perform the upgrade from a local http repository hosting the .</description>

      <description>I was recently involved with consulting for a Norwegian shipping company who has quite a few remote vSphere installations, most of them with a couple of ESXi hosts, but no vCenter and hence no Update Manager. While looking at methods for managing these installations, in particular how to facilitate patching and upgrading scenarios, I remembered that way back in 2013, I posted Quick and Dirty HTTP-based Deployment which shows how to use the Python to run a simple http daemon, and serve files from it.</description>

      <description>This is a guest post from Shane Williford Sr. Systems Engineer, VCAP-DCA/EMCCAe/Pizza Connoisseur and vExpert.
Problem History I work at a school district in the US (Kansas City area). After the school year ended, my Director decided he wanted to upgrade to vSphere6 from vSphere55U2 on a few Hosts we were using with XenApp. We are using XenApp to deliver apps to student labs that utilize an Autocad program. As such, our Hosts also have a graphics card in them – nVIDIA GRID K1.</description>

      <description>I almost choked on my coffee this morning when I saw William Lam announcing a new VMware Fling called ESXi Embedded Host Client. Finally the day when we can get a local vSphere Web Client on a standalone host is here, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a moment too soon. This feature has been missing since ESX 3 and it&amp;rsquo;s VMware Infrastructure Web Access. For now, this is a Fling (which means unsupported and so on), but I really hope that this ends up being built-in to ESXi very soon &amp;ndash; even on the free vSphere Hypervisor.</description>

&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;vanguard&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;ˈvanɡɑːd/&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; noun a group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas.</description>

Like the previous two discoveries, this one came to light only after hackers dumped online huge troves of documents stolen from Hacking Team — an Italian security firm that sells software exploits to governments around the world. This quote is from Brian Krebs, who very rightfully goes on to advise that everyone &amp;ldquo;please consider removing or at least hobbling this program.</description>

I was lucky enough to be one of the early VMware on AWS VIP Pass users, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on several setups the last few weeks. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make those available as blueprints in the new Ravello Repo, once they are ready for publishing.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m even questioning if there really is such a thing at all any more. I believe there was such a thing at one point, but it seems to be fading fast into history, only to be replaced by hyperbole of egonormous proportions. Back in the old days, and this might just be me showing my greying of beards moment, the hyperbole wasn&amp;rsquo;t a strong a force as it seems to be today.</description>

      <description>The new VMware Software Manager, which was released at the same time as vSphere 6, is a great way to get your download ducks in a row, and not manually download all the different vSphere pieces one by one.
But all these downloads sure eat up disk space, and if you, like me, chose the wrong download location while installing VMware Software Manager what do you do? There is no way in the web interface to change the download directory after installation, so how do you change it?</description>

      <description>In my work as a consultant I often have many small tasks to perform for customers, all while completing a bigger project. I have found that an easy way to keep track of all the little and big changes, is to create a ChangeLog. Normally ChangeLog&amp;rsquo;s are referenced in development projects, but it also sense to use it to track of your own, or your team members, changes to an infrastructure environment.</description>

      <description>The VMware Certified Design Expert: VCDX. THE certification of certifications, especially if you work with VMware based solutions. It&amp;rsquo;s often regarded as the holy grail of certifications, and rightfully so.
But why is this the case, and why does &amp;ldquo;everyone&amp;rdquo; want to become one?
The reasons for it being such a highly coveted title, are pretty obvious:
 Very few people can call themselves VCDX, at the time of writing only 186 people have successfully defended their design.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what happens if you give 10.000 people access to an open-beta that is supposed to be under NDA?
Firstly, the NDA is no-go from the get-go. There is no way you can claim that you actually expect 10.000 people to not talk about something they know about. VMware vSpere 6.0 was the worst kept secret ever, for a reason. It might have been planned that way all along for all I know, but if that was the case, the NDA should never have been in place to begin with.</description>

Updated: Since this post was initially published, information about the VAIO capabilities in vSphere 6.0 has been published.

I had one minor from the start though, and that was that file indexing consistently failed for the Windows VM. No big deal, but I thought it was strange at the time. After all, the Linux VMs were indexed just fine.</description>

Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t post anything like this in 2014, I can&amp;rsquo;t really go back and see how my plans turned out, or provide any assessement of it. I can say this though, 2014 was pretty awesome. I got a promotion, my vExpert status was renewed, vNinja was voted in the top 50 of the 2014 top VMware &amp;amp; virtualization vote, I published a book and finally got the Norwegian VMUG up and running.</description>

A lot of my work these days are related to generating content, be it a simple blog post like this or writing customer proposals and documentation. In the end, the deliverables are often quite different, but at the core they are strangely enough very similar.</description>

If the certificate isn&amp;rsquo;t present in the vCSA keystore when you try to authenticate with vCloud Air, you get a &amp;ldquo;Server Certificate not Verified&amp;rdquo; error, and you will be unsuccessful in configuring the plugin.</description>

While VMware Studio technically still works, even with newer versions of ESXi and vCenter, the supported operating systems for the appliances it can build is somewhat outdated:
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5&amp;frasl;6.0
 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10.2&amp;frasl;11.1

      <description>First off, this is not meant to be a post negating the value of current hyperconverged solutions available in the market. I think hyperconverged has it&amp;rsquo;s place, and for many use cases it makes perfect sense to go down that route. But the idea that everyone should go hyperconverged and all data should be placed on local drives, even if made redundant inside the chassis and even between chassis, is to be blunt, a bit silly.</description>

The VDCA550 exam is held in a live lab environment, with approximately 23 lab activities, which is the subsequently scored after the exam is finished. This means that you do not get an immediate pass/fail summary at the end of the exam, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be feverishly checking your email until the score report is sent to you from VMware.</description>

      <description>Another VMworld US is over, with huge attendee numbers and in keeping with tradition lots of new announcements were made. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go through them, enough posts have been made about that, the basis of this post is something completely different all together.
There seems to be a general expectation that we as a community is to be wooed by the announcements and flashy keynotes, but are we really the target audience?</description>

      <description>VMware has finally announced what I&amp;rsquo;ve been speculating about for some time now, EVO:RAIL was announced at VMworld US this morning. Short story; It&amp;rsquo;s a HCIA (Hyper Converged Infrastructure Appliance), offered through several hardware vendors, with a new integrated management solution.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m not at VMworld my self, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the blog postings to those close to the action, but here is a quick collection of links to get you acquainted with the next EVOlution of SDDC from VMware:</description>

      <description>VMworld US is very soon upon us, and I&amp;rsquo;m one of the jealous ones left behind not being able to attend. I will hopefully be able to join everyone oat VMworld Europe in Barcelona on October though.
An interesting Twitter hashtag #AdviceForVMworld appeared a week or so ago, with lots of good advice for people attending a huge tech conference.
Here are a few good examples:

      <description>Finally. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a way to put two of my favourite things together in a completely non-sensical way, namely VMware Marvin and Pearl Jam. As The Register reported earlier today, odds are that Marvin no longer responds to it&amp;rsquo;s project name, but rather to the new EVO name recently trademarked by VMware. There has been whispers of a Marvin name change for quite some time, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t really hard to believe.</description>

      <description>A customer of mine, who runs a pure HP environment based on c7000 and StoreServ 7200, wanted to get the HP Insight Control Storage Module for vCenter up and running. The problem was that while we were able to connect to the older MSA array they run for non-production workloads, we were unable to connect to the newer StoreServ 7200. There is full IP connectivity between the application server that the HP Insight components run on and the storage controllers/VSP (no firewalls between them, they are located in the same subnet).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I tried speculating on the soon-to-be-announced VMware Marvin project, but some very recent VMworld US 2014 session additions look really interesting in that regard:
SDDC1818 - VMware Customers Share Experiences and Requirements for Hyper-Converged SDDC2095 - VMware and Hyper-Converged Infrastructure SDDC1767 - SDDC at Scale with VMware Hyper-Converged Infrastructure: Deeper Dive SDDC3245-S - Software-Defined Data Center through Hyper-Converged Infrastructure
If you look at 1767 specifically, since the other sessions are still very light on details, it has a rather interesting description:</description>

Where the first book focused on small &amp;ldquo;tweet sized&amp;rdquo; design tips, the new one allows for more in-depth articles, lifting the first editions 200 character limit.
For some reason, I have been lucky enough to be selected as one of the contributors!

The recent speculations surrounding Marvin has now hit The Register (to bad they don&amp;rsquo;t link this way, but I guess thats how it is) as well, but one piece is still missing, arguably the most important one. We all know that the most important piece of something like this is it&amp;rsquo;s name, or acronym, not it&amp;rsquo;s technical merit&amp;hellip;
There has been a few attempts at guessing what Marvin is an acronym for, and here are some good ones from twitter:</description>

After close to a full day of Twitter speculations and discussions on what Marvin really is, some thoughts kept stuck with me, and this is my attempt at articulating what I think VMware might be up to.
_Please note that I have no real knowledge of the status of the project, nor if it really exists outside of a poster in a window in the VMware campus.</description>

The text reads &amp;ldquo;Introducing the worlds first 100% VMware powered hyper converged infrastructure appliance.&amp;rdquo; I guess some of the VMware engineers forgot that the VMware campus get external visitors from time to time&amp;hellip;

The username and password used to log in, and subsequently upload the upgrade file, was no longer working after the upgrade finished and the vShield Manager appliance had been rebooted.
It turns out that this was due to using international characters in the password for the admin user, in this case the Norwegian specialities æ, ø or å.</description>

Of course, this is a reality; If you base your current infrastructure on blade servers, VSAN probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a good match as it stands today.</description>

In short, it means that you are no longer a VCP(x) for life, but need to recertify every 2 years, unless you take a VCAP exam during the same period. If you do not upgrade your certification, your VCP status is revoked. For all the details, have a look at Recertification Policy: VMware Certified Professional.</description>

      <description>The Dell PowerEdge VRTX shared infrastructure platform is interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to be able to borrow one from Dell for testing purposes.
One of the things I wanted to test, was if it was possible to run VMware VSAN on it, even if the Shared PERC8 RAID controller it comes with is not on the VMware VSAN HCL, nor does it provide a method to do passthrough to present raw disks directly to the hosts.</description>

Of course, I completely agree with his views on this; Leaving it at the default might cause confusion down the line.
At the end of the post, William asks the following:
I wonder if it would be a useful to have a feature in VSAN to automatically append the vSphere Cluster name to the default VSAN Datastore name?</description>

      <description>During some way overdue housekeeping in my HP Microserver-based &amp;ldquo;Homelab&amp;rdquo; today, I ran into a rather annoying issue that prevented me from starting one of my more important VMs; namely my home Domain Controller.
In short, I removed an old SSD drive that I&amp;rsquo;ve used for vFlash Read Cache (vFRC) testing and installed a new 1TB drive instead. Since I have a rather beefy work lab now, I need space more than speed at home, so this seemed like a good idea at the time.</description>

      <description>When playing around with the Raspberry Pi Thin Client, I ran into an issue with the SSL certificates for the Citrix Receiver client. For some reason it didn&amp;rsquo;t want to play with the certificates installed on the server side, and popped the following error message:
**You have not chosen to trust &#34;AddTrust External CA Root&#34;, the issuer of the server&#39;s security certificate.** Thankfully there is a quick fix for this! Since Iceweasel is also in the RPTC distribution, and it has a lot more SSL root CA certificates included by default, all that was required (in my case) was to link the certificates it has with the certificates the Citrix Receiver client can use.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday, December 3, 2013 VMware User Group Denmark arranged theNordic VMUG Conference. The event itself can only be described as a mini-VMworld, with over 600 registered attendees, and a speaker list worthy of such a nick-name.
The opening keynote was held by Joe Baguley, the closing keynote was held by Chad Sakac. In between those two, you had the possibility to attend sessions held by Cormac Hogan, Mike Laverick, Frank Brix, Paudie O-Riordan, Frank Denneman, Mattias Sundling, David Davis and Duncan Epping.</description>

      <description>Some time during the Podcasting for Cancer fundraiser period I somehow suggested that we should pair it with this years Movember.
Despite my wife and daughters strenuous protests, I signed up and went all in. By all in, I mean, all in. For the first time since I went to my then employers christmas party dressed as a woman, I shaved my whole face.
My trusty goatee, who had been pretty much constantly with me since 1997, was gone.</description>

So far the VCAP Design Boot Camp has been tested in Spain, Singapore, and Malaysia, with over 300 participants so far.
In addition to this, a two part vBrownbag series covering the boot camp content was recorded and released:</description>

      <description>Microsoft has launched Virtualization2, a program to educate VMware administrators on Hyper-V and the System Center suite of tools. In short, these arefree online training sessiosn on November 19th and 20th, that also comes with a voucher for their new Microsoft virtualization certification exam (74-409).
This comes in addition to their existing Microsoft Virtualization for VMware Professionals Jump Start training course.
I think this is a good idea, and if you are able to close your eyes to the hyperbole, and disregard things like &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Wants to Help VMware Experts “Future-Proof “ Their Career&amp;rdquo;, I applaud this initiative.</description>

      <description>Yeah, I admit it. I want OS X Mavericks, and I want it now.
Unfortunately, it´s not available yet from Software Update. So instead of manually checking every 5 minutes or so, I decided to create a small bash script that does it for me.
It´s very, very simple, but I think it does the job:
First off, pop into Terminal and get root access:

      <description>For the first time since 2010 I will actually be physically attending VMworld Europe! I fly over from the very cold, rainy and generally very autumny Norway to sunny Barcelona on Sunday the 13th.
Based on my past experience from VMworld in Copenhagen, I have decided to go easy on the session scheduling and not fill my calendar to the brim.
Sure, the sessions provide insane amounts of useful content, but for me the main reason to attend VMworld is to physically meet up and talk to a lot of the people I usually spend a lot of time communicating with.</description>

      <description>With the new vSphere 5.5 release, the VMware vCenter Appliance (vCSA) has grown up to be a viable alternative to the traditional Microsoft Windows based vCenter deployment scenario. The new vCSA version supports up to 100 hosts and 3000 (with an external Oracle database the values change to 1000&amp;frasl;10000) virtual machines, a big improvement from 5 hosts and 50 virtual machines in the previous version.
Sadly, the only external database option available for vCSA 5.</description>

Straight forward procedure, but there is one small caveat in this process.
One important thing to remember, and something I don´t feel that the knowledge-base article highlights well enough is that the new v5.</description>

      <guid>/vmware-2/combine-vsphere-host-cache-vflash-single-ssd/</guid>
      <description>One of the new features in vSphere 5.5 is the vSphere vFlash that enables you to use a SSD/Flash device as a read cache for your storage. Duncan Epping has a series of posts on vSphere Flash Cache that is well worth a read.
vSphere vFlash caches your read IOs, but at the same time you can use it as a swap device if you run into memory contention issues. The vSphere vFlash Host Cache is similar to the older Host Cache feature, but if you are upgrading from an older version of ESXi there is a couple of things that needs to be done to be able to use this feature.</description>

When the appliance is deployed, the first time you log in you get presented with the configuration wizard. The wizard clearly states that if you want to set a static ip, or hostname, you should cancel the wizard, do the network configuration and then re-run the wizard after the fact.
Well, that´s what I did, and it resulted in the following error when trying to create the embedded database:</description>

Place the host in maintenance mode, then run the following command to do an online update to ESXi 5.5:

      <description>As Eric Siebert has pointed out, the VMware vSphere release cycles are shortening.
While vSphere 5.1 could be seen as a bit rushed, especially in regards to SSO, when it was released, the shorter release cycles seem to work out pretty well.
This does make me think though; vSphere 5.5 is pretty much ready to be released to the general public, and the new VSAN component will be in a public beta at the same time.</description>

Simply put, &amp;ldquo;the change&amp;rdquo; was not that hard and most everything has worked without problems, and for those things that still require Microsoft Windows, well, there is VMware Fusion for that.
While I´m admittedly still a novice OS X user, and not even close to mastering OS X, I´d like to share my current Slate setup.</description>

      <description>When doing manual host upgrades, either through the direct method or via a locally placed upgrade bundle, there is a distinct lack of progress information available after running the esxcli command.
Thankfully the ESXi host provides a running logfile of the upgrade process, which makes it much easier to keep track of what is going on and that the upgrade is indeed being performed.
The esxupdate.log is located in /var/log, and by issuing the following command in a terminal window you can have a rolling log showing you the upgrade status and progress:</description>

This is a trivial task on it`s own, just create a vSwitch with no physical NICs attached to it, and then connect the VMs to it. The VMs will then have interconnectivity, but no outside network access at all.
In this particular case, I was setting up a couple of nested ESXi servers that I wanted to connect to the &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; vCenter Appliance (VCSA).</description>

The workaround provided by Veeam is to create host VM-Host Affinity Rules, effectively pinning a VM to a given host, and then perform the VM backup through the host rather than through the vCenter.</description>

      <description>This week I´m working at a client site, upgrading their entire existing vSphere 4.1 infrastructure to vSphere 5.1. The customer engagement also includes upgrading Veeam Backup and Replication 6.0 to 6.5, and usually an isolated upgrade of Veeam B&amp;amp;R is a no-brainer next, next, next, done install.
To complicate things in this particular environment, I also had to migrate the vCenter SQL DB from a local MS SQL Server 2005 Express instance to a full-fledged MS SQL Server 2008 R2 instance.</description>

      <description>Autolab, that awesome &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; thing that automagically builds a nested vSphere Lab environment for you, was definitely not put together by Flint Lockwood but by Alastair Cooke (www.demitasse.co.nz). Unlike Flint´s inventions, this one actually makes sense and serves a purpose!
Now, how sweet would it be to deploy Autolab without having to invest time, money and effort into acquiring your own hardware?
Well, thanks to baremetalcloud.com, you might now actually be able to do just that (and more, if you wish).</description>

The new pricing is very attractive, especially since you no longer need to buy access on a course by course basis.
The courses are delivered in your browser, but Trainsignal also offers an offline player in case you need access when traveling or otherwise offline.</description>

      <description>VMware Labs has released a new fling called Makyo (魔境 _makyō_ means “ghost cave” or “devil’s cave.”) which basically is a tool to copy VMs or vApps from one vCenter instance to another.
It works by doing an automated OVF export on the source vCenter, and then an import on the destination vCenter.

The plugin integrates directly into the vSphere Web Client, and I hope to see this feature installed by default in future versions of the Web Client.</description>

      <description>My recent experience with setting up vCenter Operations Manager on a standalone ESXi host, and the always excellent William Lam´s post Automating VCSA Network Configurations For Greenfield Deployments got me thinking.
There are several other appliances out there that require deployment to a vCenter, to be able to configure the networking options and not just default to DHCP. In many, and perhaps even most, cases you can work around that by running the _vami_set_network _command to change from DHCP to STATIC network configurations.</description>

      <description>A client of mine recently had their vCenter 5.0 appliance replaced with a new vCenter 5.1 appliance, something vCenter Operations Manager did not enjoy. In this case the original vCenter 5.0 Appliance was turned shut down, a new 5.1 Appliance deployed, with the same IP as the old one, and then configured. Naturally the existing hosts were added to the fresh vCenter, clusters recreated and in general everything was reconfigured.</description>

While the quote itself is correct, I feel that there is a need to further expand on what I said, in the context it was given in.
So here it is, my entire response:
My reaction to Steve Herrods departure is probably on par with just about everyone else&#39;s, one of surprise.</description>

      <description>In order to be able to deploy vCenter Operations Manager, the ESXi host it is deployed to needs to be managed by a vCenter. At first glance, that seems like a fair and pretty straight forward requirement, right? But, is it?
While I can see the need for a vCenter in the environment that vCenter Operations Manager is supposed to monitor, I don´t understand why the host you want to deploy the vApp on has to be managed by a vCenter instance as well?</description>

Seeing that announcement, and the fact that Christopher was nice enough to mention both me and vNinja.net in it, I have decided to also give away a license that has been lingering unused in my possession way to long.
Instead of running my own contest, my license has been added to the existing contest so head on over there to read all the details.</description>

      <description>One of the smaller improvements in vSphere 5 was the introduction of the &amp;ldquo;Virtual machine disks consolidation is needed&amp;rdquo; configuration alert if vSphere determines that there are orphaned snapshots for a given VM.

Previous versions does not show this warning message, and datastore usage could potentially skyrocket for no apparent reason if something continues to create snapshots that are not properly cleaned up when they are no longer in use.</description>

vCenter Operations Manager now comes in the following flavors:</description>

      <description>Post Update: As per Preetam´s comment, HP has published a customer advisory regarding the usage of install vs update.
After installing a couple of brand new HP ProLiant BL460c G8 blades with HP Smart Array P220i controllers at a customer site, I decided that I should upgrade from the VMware-ESXi-5.0.0-Update1-623860-HP-5.20.43.iso Build 623860 used to install the blades, to the latest 821926 build offered by VMware.
Normally this is a really easy process using VMware Update Manager, but since this is a new installation all the prerequisites for that are not in place just yet and I decided to use esxcli to perform the update.</description>

vShield Endpoint is now included in every vSphere edition, with the exception of the lowest tier vSphere Essentials package.
I was under the impression that you had to upgrade to the new 5.1 version to take advantage of the licensing change, and get licenses available for vShield Endpoint, but a new VMware Knowledgebase article named KB: 2036875 Downloading and enabling vShield Endpoint on supported vSphere platforms debunks that.</description>

      <description>Now that vSphere 5.1 and assorted products have been released into the wild, how do you check the integrity of your downloaded file? As you might be aware of, VMware publishes both MD5 and SHA1 hashes for their files, making it possible to check if the file you just downloaded is identical to the file offered from VMware.
Checking the MD5 or SHA1 hash for a single file is easy, at least in OS X where you don´t need any third party tools to check.</description>

This Public vCloud “Test-Drive” service, which VMware themselves describe as “white-label” from a vCloud service provider, seems like a way for VMware to provide cheap test-drive access, to vCloud through their existing service providers.
Where the rumored &amp;ldquo;Project Zephyr&amp;rdquo; might be seen as a competing service, Public vCloud looks to be engineered to drive long term customers to the existing ecosystem of providers.</description>

      <description>Mike Laverick and Barry Coombs has released their new book, elegantly titled &amp;ldquo;Building End-User Computing Solutions with VMware View&amp;rdquo;.
Not only is this a great book, it is something that every existing and potential VMware View (and related technologies in the EUC area) administrator should add to their (digital) bookshelves.
I´ll let the authors themselves describe it:
This book is all about VMware View 5.1 and ThinApp 4.7.2 administration - and it takes in a wide scope of complementary technologies from the likes of Teradici, BitDefender and F5 Networks.</description>

      <description>I´ve been a Mac and OS X user now for about 7 months, but to be honest I have not been very experimental in my usage of my Macbook Air. Until now, my main focus has been basic usage of the hardware and operating systems, and making it work in my corporate environment. As I feel that I´ve reached mission accomplished status on that initial project, I decided to use some of my &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; vacation time to play around a bit and experiment a bit more.</description>

As mentioned before, there has been a lot of talk about various ways to create a &amp;ldquo;soapbox&amp;rdquo; for all those who submitted VMworld sessions and got rejected, or those who did not submit but would still like to present.
Thankfully the guys behind vBrownBags has teamed up with VMware communities and are now offering this opportunity at VMworld 2012.</description>

Today VMware has sent out notifications to VMworld 2012 session submitters, with a yay or nay email. Of course, this sparked a lot of conversation on Twitter, and Scott Lowe published a blog post proposing a VMworld Unconference, and exploring several options:
 A physical “unconference”
 A virtual “unconference”

      <description>The Thinapped vSphere Client has finally been updated to v5.0, and is readily available for download!
Sadly the new version is v5.0 only, and will only allow you to connect to vSphere v5 hosts and since the new release has replaced the old release on the VMware Fling website, you´re out of luck if you haven´t already got the 4.0 version stowed away in your own private locker.
I hope VMware decides to either make the 4.</description>

Update 17th September 2014: VMware has published the official list in knowledge base article KB2089791, use that as the official list going forward.
Remember, the client download URL is still available from the vCenter server, if you point your browser to it.</description>

I was well aware of this deadline since mid December, however, I procrastinated on studying and was mostly flinging myself around the globe doing implementations and having an all around good time. When Feb 1st came I was sitting on a flight from Saigon to Frankfurt and that is when panic struck.</description>

Scott Sauer has announced the availability of &amp;ldquo;VMware Virtual Customer Labs” (vCL) where he walks us through the setup and delivery of the new vCL offering.
At the moment it´s only available to &amp;ldquo;selected customers&amp;rdquo;, supported by a VMware pre-sales engineer, and the number of labs are limited. It´s still a work in progress, and I´m sure great things will come out of this!</description>

      <description>As Mr. Simon Seagrave has pointed out, there is a fix available to enable OSX Lion Time Machine support for Iomega IX2 and IX4 NAS storage devices.
I decided to take this a little step further, and try to upgrade my old (and discontinued) Iomega IX2-200 to the new IX2-200 Cloud Edition firmware.
Initially this was a big failure, as I seemingly managed to brick my device. It was only responding to pings (so the TCP/IP stack was loaded and working), but I could not bring up the web based management tool nor connect via telnet or SSH.</description>

I followed the same steps as he did in his Running Bitlocker on a Virtual computer post, and it worked perfectly.
The only real difference between doing this in Hyper-V and on ESXi, is that the virtual floppy drive on ESXi by default doesn&amp;rsquo;t emulate an empty floppy.</description>

      <description>Yes, this is YAEotYP, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve already read tons of them I apologize.
2011 - My personal view 2011 has been a steamroller of a year.The vSoup Virtualization Podcast got aired the first time, and we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded and published 19 full episodes in the inaugural year. I was awarded the vExpert title for the first time, and even got invited to Tech Field Day #6 in Boston.
In addition to this, I wrote a white paper for Veeam, was included in the Server Virtualization Advisory Board, joined Rick Vanover for a Veeam Community Podcast, and appeared in two video interviews.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a bit about this before, both on vSoup and in Setting Up Automated ESXi Deployments where I outlined my PXE and PowerCLI based installation and configuration scheme. Not much has changed since then, except updating the PXE server to offer ESXi 5, instead of ESXi 4 and a lot of work has been put into the scripting, including a front-end GUI for the PowerCLI script itself.</description>

      <description>A little while ago I fitted a small 64GB SSD disk to my HP MicroServer just to have a quick look at the new vSphere 5 feature Swap to Host Cache, where vSphere 5 reclaims memory by storing the swapped out pages in the host cache on a solid-state drive. Naturally, this is a lot faster than swapping to non-SSD storage, but you will still see a performance hit when this happens.</description>

      <description>Mike Laverick has started something of a petition to bring back the VMTN Subscription option, and I could not agree more!
The VMTN Subscription was a way for interested parties to pay for a years subscription to VMware products, akin to the Microsoft Technet subscription program. It&amp;rsquo;s not intended for production use, but as a means to get hold of products for lab work, testing and development.
I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why VMware pulled the plug on that option back in 2007, but I do understand why it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring it back to life.</description>

      <description>Juan Manuel Rey&amp;rsquo;s post Monitor ESX 4.x to ESXi 5.0 migration process show how you can watch the progress of an ESX 4 to ESXi 5 upgrade procedure, by looking at the live logs.
While this is very useful, and in many cases a real learning experience, it got me thinking that these logs should be available remotely as well. Since ESXi supports, and actively encourages, the use of an external Syslog service for log file safekeeping and monitoring, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the installation logs for ESXi also be logged externally if configured?</description>

Very useful when testing applications and servers and want to know how they react to network issues, or if you want to simulate a WAN link. I know this was available in Workstation 7 as well, but it used to be a team feature.</description>

Even if it is run by Veeam, it does not focus on Veeam specific products or services, but rather on the general ideas behind a successful backup and disaster recovery of both VMware and Hyper-V based environments.</description>

      <description>VMware is close (still in beta) to releasing the new major release of VMware Workstation.
Update 14. September 2011: VMware Workstation 8 has now officially been released.
VMware Workstation 8 brings a lot of new features and enhancements to the table, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to play around with it in the beta program.
VMware Workstation 8 System Requirements To be able to install VMware Workstation, the host system processor needs to meet the following requirements:</description>

      <description>VMware Labs now has fixed data centers which means that the VMworld Hands-On labs are going to be publicly available in early 20112!
Hear Mornay Van Der Walt, Senior Director R&amp;amp;D at VMware, explain the details in this video from VMworld TV:
This is great news, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who thinks this is a really good idea.</description>

      <description>The last couple of days I&amp;rsquo;ve been in training class, taking the 6451B Planning, Deploying and Managing Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007 course.
One of the first things that got mentioned, was that for larger deployments you should not run System Center Configuration Manager virtually. Of course, this caught my eye as I&amp;rsquo;m a proponent for the virtualize first &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo;.
It runs out that the reason for this is that Configuration Manager is somewhat poorly designed, as just about everything it receives from the clients in the network is placed in text based log files (inbox folder) before being processed and pumped into the back-end SQL DB.</description>

      <description>Not that WSUS is expensive, after all it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; addon to the server you&amp;rsquo;re already running if you need it. Of course, running your own Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) infrastructure is preferable in just about every scenario except for some edge cases where bandwidth or latency issues might prevent you from syncing the updates from a central repository. Sadly, these edge cases enter the fray from time to time and I recently found myself in the middle of such a scenario.</description>

      <description>The up and coming release of VMware vSphere 5 comes with an upgraded versjon of the VMware vStorage VMFS volume file system. One of the problems with VMFS-3 an earlier is that the block size you define when you format the datastore, determines the maximum size of the VMDK files stored on it. This means that when planning your datastore infrastructure you must have an idea on how large your VMDK files will potentially be during the lifecycle of the datastore.</description>

John lives and breathes his role, as Senior Social Media Strategist at VMware, and I have to say that one of the most brilliant moves VMware has done is to employ John in his current role. Lots of other corporation employ marketing people in their social media roles, VMware went the other way and put the very technically savvy Dr.</description>

      <description>As many of you did I watched todays Cloud Infrastructure Forum and the release of vSphere 5 today. I was very excited with many of the features such as Storage Profiling, Storage DRS, VMFS 5 release, and they have blown the top off of the resource limits on VMs to create Monster VMs - just to mention a few. However, one topic I notice causing quite a stir is the new licensing that seemed to be very briefly mentioned at the end of the webinar.</description>

      <description>Automating ESXi installs was made much easier after the release of vSphere 4.1 where the Scripted Install feature was added, and by using VMware Auto Deploy from VMware Labs. VMware Auto Deploy requires that you have vCenter and Host Profiles in your environment, and that again requires that you have Enterprise Plus licenses in your environment.
It is, however, possible to deploy ESXi in an automated fashion completely without vCenter and Host Profiles!</description>

Sometimes my career in this sector brings me into working with stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with before because virtualization encompasses so much. As I continue to work with other teams I learn more and more about what they do everyday. I usually find myself involved in every performance troubleshooting session and every new project these days.</description>

We weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to talk about it until the 22nd and I know I am a little slow on the punch but I currently haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a lot of coverage. Just for an initial disclosure statement my trip to Tech Field Day 6 was paid for by the vendors we visited, however, I am in no way obligated to write about them or publicize them in any manner.</description>

In reality this is the first published article I have ever written, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish on my own. I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it, yet strangely nervous about how it will be received by the people who download it. If you happen to do so, make sure to let me know how you found it, all comments and criticism will be most appreciated.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, vCenter Integration Mantra, I made the point that vSphere vAdmins wants the 3rd party modules to integrate into the vCenter client and show their delicious addon-value there, and not in their own management interface. Give the vAdmins the info they need, where they do most, if not all their work. Open up the admin client and let us get all that juicy and fruity information we need.</description>

      <description>During Tech Field Day #6 in Boston one particular general feature request has become increasingly prominent;
Can we have it inside the vCenter client?
In short, what we want is for all those great third party vendors like VKernel, Solarwinds and others to be able to put their feature addons directly into the vCenter client. Currently most third party apps &amp;ldquo;integrate&amp;rdquo; by offering a new tab where you can access it, but I would love to see that being expanded even further.</description>

Christopher Wells had already arrived earlier in the day, and I was lucky enough to be picked up by Stephen Foskett at the airport and chauffeured to the Sheraton Framingham Hotel and Conference center.
The travel itself was pretty uneventful, the only trouble I had was that when I landed at Schipol for transfer to the US flight, my boarding pass was nowhere to be found, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I even received it when I checked in at Bergen Airport Flesland.</description>

You could consider this a sincere compliment from the Gestalt IT community as your name was suggested and we think you are the kind of person we all would love to have as part of our community. This means you&#39;re independent-minded, technology-focused, community-oriented, and a thought leader in the area of IT infrastructure.  Of course, this is pretty much hogwash, but nevertheless I&amp;rsquo;m extremely honored to be invited as a delegate for Tech Field Day #6 in Boston, Mass.</description>

The voting is available to anyone who has a vmworld.com account, and the voting period is from May 9th to May 18th. The voting is global, which means a vote for a session counts as a vote for both VMworld US and VMworld EMEA as 80% of the selected sessions will occur at both events.</description>

The venue and location at DogA - the Norwegian Centre for Design and Architecture was very nice, but sadly I must ask VMware who the intended audience for the VMware Forum event is?
According to the invitation the audience target is:
People that will benefit from attending VMware Forum 2011 include: CIO, CFO and General Managers Infrastructure and Datacenter Managers IT Managers and Directors Security Managers Systems Administrators Desktop, SOE Managers Application Managers, Application Administrators Application Developers IT Procurement Mangers Sadly I fail to see how the VMware Forum 2011 in Oslo would be very beneficial for existing VMware customers, at least not at a technical level.</description>

What I can say though, is that the first impression is pretty great. It looks good, works well and might be one of the apps that finally gives me an actual use case for the iPad.</description>

      <description>In the last couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Microsoft Word 2010 a lot more than I&amp;rsquo;ve previously done, and at the same time I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching computers a lot making it somewhat of an annoyance that a lot of the words I use in my documents are not recognized and marked with a wiggly red line underneath it.
If only there was a way to keep the custom dictionary synchronized between computers.</description>

      <title>Using rsync to Distribute Patches to a Remote vMA </title>

      <description>I recently posted Using vMA as a local vSphere Patch Repository, where I outlined how you can use your vMA instances as local file repositories for updates.
This post is a continuation of that concept, but this time I&amp;rsquo;ll take it a step further and utilize rsync to make sure my vMA instances all contain the same set of patches. Rsync is great for this, as it handles fast incremental file transfers, which is a real time and bandwidth saver in my particular scenario.</description>

      <description>I like using http as the transport protocol when patching my vSphere hosts. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and in most cases immediately available over most networks. Since I want to use http as the transport, we need to make vMA work as a http server.
Starting Apache inside vMA Luckily, the Apache http daemon is installed, by default, in vMA and to utilize it all you have to do is to start it!</description>

      <description>The vMA is a Virtual Appliance that you can download from VMware. It&amp;rsquo;s primary function is to enable command line based management of your ESX/ESXi systems.
Basically this is a pre-packaged virtual machine that includes vCLI and the vSphere SDK for Perl, which means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to build your own management VM or install these tools locally on a management station.
vMA is in many regards seen as a replacement for the ESX Service Console which no longer is present in ESXi.</description>

The fact of the matter is that in many cases Bob is right, virtualization admins ends up being blamed for everything.
No matter who’s fault it actually is, though, I’m the one-stop shop now for blame.</description>

      <description>Remote Desktop Connection Manager is a great tool from Microsoft which enables you to keep track of all your RDP sessions and targets in a nice GUI. One of the things it&amp;rsquo;s lacking though, is some sort of Active Directory connection that allows you to import all your server objects directly, and not manually add/remove the serves as your infrastructure changes over time.
In an attempt to bridge that gap, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a very small PowerShell script that queries your Active Directory for server objects and dumps their names into a text file that you can import into RDCMan.</description>

      <description>Jan Egil Ring over at blog.powershell.no has created a great PowerShell script that lets you run the Microsoft Best Practices Analyzer on remote Windows Server 2008 R2 machines.
In short, Invoke-BPAModeling.ps1 queries your Active Directory for any machines that run Windows Server 2008 R2, runs BPA on them (if Windows PowerShell Remoting is enabled) and emails you the report.
Great tool that should be in every Windows Server admins tool-belt, and probably also set as a scheduled job to make sure you stay up to date on your servers status.</description>

      <description>Watchguard has recently retired their X series of firewalls and replaced them with their new lineup of XTM boxes.
I took this opportunity to replace my X series firewalls with some from the new lineup, and found a neat way to migrate your existing configuration from old to new in a few very easy steps.

Note: _Normally I would not recommend migrating your configuration in this manner. In my mind you should always rebuild rules when replacing your firewall, as it is the perfect time to review and do some QA.</description>

What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say here is that yours truly, Ed Czerwin and Chris Dearden has decided that we want to be rock-stars and start our own little virtualization related podcast.</description>

2010 was the year I really feel that I got a lot of good work done, and some of that are really significant changes for my organization which is in a way better state IT wise now than in 2009.</description>

Since I work for a shipping company, the ability to emulate VSAT conditions are especially useful for testing and proof-of-concept scenarios.
You can use WANem a couple of different ways but my setup is pretty simple but does the job perfectly.
Downloading WANem I have chose to use the WANem Virtual Appliance running in a virtual machine hosted by VMware Workstation.</description>

      <description>When Rich Brambley posted &amp;ldquo;A Pirate Invented Server Virtualization&amp;rdquo; today, it reminded me of a little story from my own production environment.
This story is a couple of years old, but sadly it&amp;rsquo;s still valid. A very specialized application that we run, requires a SQL Server Express instance, a proxy/licensing server and client installation with license files to work. This application isn&amp;rsquo;t very advanced, nor very resource intensive so by nature it&amp;rsquo;s prime for running in a virtualized environment.</description>

@h0bbel Do you know if I can script something against vCenter to duplicate (or create from template) VMs, and also start/stop them? My immediate response, was of course to suggest using PowerCLI. Asbjørn, who works as a full time developer, jumped at PowerCLI immediately and within a very short time frame came up with a PowerCLI script for the task at hand.</description>

However, I do have a couple of suggestions I would like to voice:
 Add contact information to the attendee badge!
  Just like David Owen (@vMackem) suggested, adding Twitter ID and blog link to the attendee badge would make it easier to keep track of everyone you meet up with.</description>

      <description>I’m back home again, after spending the better part of this week in Copenhagen, attending VMworld Europe 2010.
Let me just say, straight off the bat, that attending VMworld is probably the best idea I’ve had in years. In reality, that’s not saying much, but the value of attending is immense.
The way VMworld is organized, with lots of simultaneous sessions, labs and other activities is both a challenge and a blessing.</description>

      <description>Undoubtedly one of the most popular &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; of VMworld 2010, both in the US and in EU, are the labs. These hands-on exercises in configuring and using various VMware products lets you play around without the need for lab equipment or licenses installed locally.  What if VMware extended this to not only run during the VMworld conferences?
Let us get our hands dirty all year round! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to have a full lab setup in the office, and if we could book time in the VMware Cloud Lane to play around with VMware vCloud™, VMware vCenter™ Site Recovery Manager or even VMware ThinApp™ that would be great!</description>

      <description>Sometimes leaving the defaults in place might just come back and bite you, hard.
That might also be the case with your vCenter 4.1 database, as I experienced back in July.
All of a sudden my vCenter Server stopped working. The symptoms where pretty obvious, my client couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to the vCenter server. Naturally I connected to the server, and noticed that the VMware VirtualCenter Server services had indeed stopped. No wonder the client couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to it.</description>

      <description>We all know, and love, the fact that vSphere Hypervisor is free of charge. The free version doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with all the bells and whistles of the fully licensed product, but it&amp;rsquo;s still very usable in many scenarios.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating the possibilities of running vSphere Hypervisor on a number of floating branch offices, also known as vessels.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going into details about the proposed setup, and how we intend to roll it and so on, but one of the things I really wanted to get out of this was to have all my off-site vSphere Hypervisor installs appear in my vCenter Client.</description>

The question is often either &amp;ldquo;Should I virtualize my Domain Controllers, and if so should I virtualize all of them?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Should I do a P2V (Physical 2 Virtual) conversion of my existing Domain Controllers, or create new ones?&amp;ldquo;

Why are there no folders under Host and Clusters view ? from Maish Saidel-Keesing got the ball rolling.
Could it be that the design of the client itself helps perpetuate the myth the resource pools is an organizational unit, one that should be used as a way of grouping VMs?</description>

Basically, what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for is a small chassis, low noise branch office server that would be used to host a single virtual machine, offering Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) and Distributed File System (DFS) file-shares.
Initially it looked to fit the bill perfectly:</description>

      <description>During preparation and preliminary information gathering for a new internal project, I had a need to emulate various networking conditions and scenarios. More specifically I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the possibility of running the vCenter Client over high latency satellite links, with varying bandwidth availability and even packet loss scenarios.
Obviously the best way of testing this, in a controlled environment, is to use some kind of WAN emulator that lets you control the various networking characteristics.</description>

      <description>Dwayne Lessner who runs IT Blood Pressure, has written a guest post on GestaltIT called Is My Favourite VSphere Tool Is Going Away?
In his article, Dwayne talks about vCenter Update Manager 4.1, and the fact that it seems to be the last version of the tools that will allow you to patch your Windows and Linux guests:
 VMware vCenter Update Manager Features. vCenter Update Manager 4.1 and its subesquent update releases are the last releases to support scanning and remediation of patches for Windows and Linux guest operating systems and applications running inside a virtual machine.</description>

      <description>VMware has published a new whitepaper called VMware vCenter Server Performance and Best Practices.
This is a must read if you manage a vCenter 4.1 installation, or are currently planning your upgrade.
The whitepaper highlights the performance improvements in the latest version, sizing guidelines, best practices and some really good real world information from several case studies. One simple, but probably often overlooked tip, is that the amount of vCenter Clients connected to your vCenter Server has an impact on it&amp;rsquo;s performance.</description>

      <description>Over at PlanetVM Wil van Antwerpen posted The Future of VMware Server back in May 2010. Wil makes the argument that it seems like VMware is indeed abandoning VMware Server as a product, leaving us with VMware Workstation and VMware Player as the two Windows installable virtualization solutions from the company.
This has caused some reactions, including my own comment, where I question the smartness of abandoning what might just be one of the best virtualization &amp;ldquo;gateway drugs&amp;rdquo; VMware has to offer.</description>

      <title>Using USB Pass-through in vSphere 4.1</title>

      <description>Finally USB pass-through is possible on ESX hosts with the new vSphere 4.1 release! This feature ha been available in VMware Workstation/Fusion and Player for quite a while. The freshly added feature in vSphere 4.1 even works if you vMotion the guest from one host to another, which is in itself pretty amazing functionality!
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to setup and use the new USB pass-through feature in vSphere 4.</description>

      <description>If you run your vCenter on SQL Server Express 2005, you are missing the ability to set up scheduled backup jobs with SQL Maintenance Plans, a feature available in the full version of SQL Server.
This might not be a problem if your backup software has SQL Server agents that you use to backup your vCenter databaser, but in smaller environments or even in your lab, you might not have that kind of backup scheme available to you, so what do you do?</description>

      <title>Migrating your vCenter from 32bit to 64bit</title>

      <guid>/virtualization/migrating-your-vcenter-from-32bit-to-64bit/</guid>
      <description>As you may or may not know, the new vCenter 4.1 requires that the host it runs on is 64 bit. As 4.0 and previous versions weren&amp;rsquo;t supported on 64 bit at all, this probably means that when you upgrade you will need to move your existing database to a new host.
There are several ways of doing the migration, but one way is to backup your existing database, and restore it on a new host and point the new vCenter 4.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new playground. I used to post quite a lot over at my old site, h0bbel.p0ggel.org but given it&amp;rsquo;s weird domain name and it&amp;rsquo;s long history I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start fresh.
This new site will be dedicated to all things virtualization, PowerShell, Windows Server management and possibly even some Citrix products thrown in here and there. I might even go on about APP-V, but that remains to be seen.</description>
