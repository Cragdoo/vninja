<p><a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2010/06/11/455115.aspx">Remote Desktop Connection Manager</a> is a great tool from Microsoft which enables you to keep track of all your RDP sessions and targets in a nice GUI. One of the things it&rsquo;s lacking though, is some sort of Active Directory connection that allows you to import all your server objects directly, and not manually add/remove the serves as your infrastructure changes over time.</p>

<p>In an attempt to bridge that gap, I&rsquo;ve made a very small PowerShell script that queries your Active Directory for server objects and dumps their names into a text file that you can import into RDCMan. This is a very simple solution, but works great in my environment.</p>

<h4 id="getallservers-ps1">GetAllServers.ps1</h4>

<pre><code>Import-Module ActiveDirectory 

$servers = Get-ADComputer -LDAPFilter &quot;(operatingsystem=*Windows Server*)&quot; | select name,dnshostname
$Date = Get-Date
$filename = &quot;Servers-{0}{1:d2}{2:d2}&quot; -f $date.year,$date.month,$date.day
foreach ($server in $servers) { 

$servername = $server.name

#Customize this for your environment
$servername | Out-File -append -encoding ASCII &lt;path&gt;\$filename.txt

}
</code></pre>

<p>In short, replace the path in <strong>line 11</strong>, and you should be able to run the script. It will then create a file called servers-{current-date}.txt in the path you have specified. This is a simple text file with one server defined on each line.</p>

<p>This file can then be imported into RDCMan by going to the <em>Edit</em> menu and select <em>Import Servers</em>. This brings up  the <em>Import Servers</em> dialog box where you can browse to the file that the PowerShell script created. Click on the <em>Import Button</em> and all your servers should now be listed in RDCMan. The next time you need to update, delete the existing servers, re-run the PowerShell script and import again.</p>

<p><a href="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/RDCMan-1.png"><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/RDCMan-1.png" alt="" /></a>
<a href="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/RDCMan-2.png"><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/RDCMan-2-300x231.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>While this isn&rsquo;t a fully automated solution, and I really wish RDCMan could do this for you by querying AD directly and finding new servers and removing the ones that are no longer present and so on, it is a quick way to get your current servers into RDCMan without manually creating each and every entry.</p>

<h4 id="update">Update:</h4>

<p>After I initially posted this, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/janegilring">Jan Egil Ring</a>, pointed me to his solution which is a <em>bit</em> more elaborate. Have a look at his solution &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.powershell.no/2010/06/02/dynamic-remote-desktop-connection-manager-connection-list/">Dynamic Remote Desktop Connection Manager connection list</a>&rdquo;, which is how it really should be done&hellip;</p>
