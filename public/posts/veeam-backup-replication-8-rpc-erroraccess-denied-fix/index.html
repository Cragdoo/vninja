  <p>I recently set up a new <a href="http://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v8</a> demo lab, and my intial small job that consisted of two different Linux VMs and one Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller was chugging along nicely. I had one minor from the start though, and that was that file indexing consistently failed for the Windows VM. No big deal, but I thought it was strange at the time. After all, the Linux VMs were indexed just fine.Â <a href="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Veeam-1.png"><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Veeam-1-300x272.png" alt="Veeam-1" /></a></p>

<p>Fast forward a few days, and all of a sudden Veeam B&amp;R was unable to back up the Windows VM at all, failing with the following error:</p>

<p>[cc width=&ldquo;100%&rdquo; theme=&ldquo;blackboard&rdquo; nowrap=&ldquo;0&rdquo;]
18.01.2015 19:48:01 :: Processing Joey Error: Failed to check whether snapshot is in progress (network mode).
RPC function call failed. Function name: [IsSnapshotInProgress]. Target machine: [192.168.5.5].
RPC error:Access is denied.
Code: 5
[/cc]</p>

<p>Nothing had changed in my environment, no patches had been installed, no changes made to the backup job or the credentials used. I even tried deleting the job, this is a demo environment after all, and re-creating it, but with the same end result.</p>

<p>As the <strong>Access is denied</strong> message clearly states, this had to be related to permissions somehow, but I was using domain administrator credentials (again, this is a <em>lab</em>), so all the required permissions should be in place, and the credentials test in the backup job also checked out just fine. It has also worked fine for 5 or 6 days, so I was a bit baffled.</p>

<p>In the end, I tried changing from using <strong>User Principle Name (UPN)</strong> connotation of <em>administrator@domain.local</em> in the credentials for the VM, to using <strong>Down-Level Logon Name</strong> aka <em>domain\administrator</em> and retried the job.</p>

<p><a href="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Veeam-2.png"><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Veeam-2-300x272.png" alt="Veeam-2" /></a><strong>That did the trick, and it also fixed the indexing problems I&rsquo;ve had since setting up the job in the first place.</strong></p>

<p>According to this <a href="http://forums.veeam.com/vmware-vsphere-f24/rpc-function-call-failed-rpc-error-acces-is-denied-t24111.html">Veeam Community Forum thread</a> this was also a problem in v7 and has something to do with how the Microsoft API&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>So, if your Veeam Backup &amp; Replication jobs fail with access denied messages, and/or can&rsquo;t index the VM files, check your credentials. They may work, but they <em>might</em> just be entered in the wrong format.</p>
