<p>A little over a year ago I posted <a href="http://vninja.net/workflow/combining-todoist-evernote-awesome/">Combining Todoist and Evernote, because awesome</a> and I thought it was about time to post a follow up now one year later.</p>

<h2 id="evernote">Evernote:</h2>

<p>Firstly, my <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> is still a giant mess, just as it was a year ago. I have lots of data in Evernote, but it&rsquo;s main purpose is just storing quick notes on ongoing projects and it serves as a basis for generating proper documentation. For that purpose it works really well, but I can&rsquo;t seem to be able to actually use it for much beyond that. For me, Evernote is the equivalent of a <em>shed</em>: <em>A place you put all your stuff, only to realize you never use it again.</em></p>

<p>Since my original post, I&rsquo;ve stopped my <strong>Todoist Task -&gt; Evernote IFTT</strong> recipe. After all, it did was to store even more unneeded stuff in my shed.</p>

<h2 id="todoist">Todoist:</h2>

<p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Todoist2.png" alt="Todoist2" />2015 was the first full year I&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://todoist.com">Todoist</a> as my primary task manager. 722 completed tasks later, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with it._ It&rsquo;s easy to work with, very flexible, and doesn&rsquo;t get in the way._ I have the iOS app running on my phone, the desktop application running on OS X and the Outlook plugin running in my corporate VM.</p>

<p>It helps me focus on the things I need to get done, and if I need to take notes or document things in relation to those tasks, I create Evernote notes for them manually.  I&rsquo;ve tried several ToDo task managers in the past, but Todoist is the first one that&rsquo;s stuck with me.</p>

<p>Plus, completing a task given me <a href="https://todoist.com/karma">Karma</a> points. I like karma, especially when it goes in my favor.</p>

<p>Now, of course, I have to do <em>some</em> automation. Everything I tag with &ldquo;<em>reading</em>&rdquo; in Pocket, gets added to my &ldquo;<em>To Read</em>&rdquo; project in Todoist. That provides me with a nice list of things I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read later, all within the same interface as my daily tasks.</p>

<p>Has it made me more productive? I don&rsquo;t know. What I do know is this:** It certainly makes it much harder to forget to do something, and that can&rsquo;t be bad.**</p>
