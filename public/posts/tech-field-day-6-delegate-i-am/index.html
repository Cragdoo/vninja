<p>A while ago I got a surprising email, stating the following:</p>

<blockquote>You could consider this a sincere compliment from the Gestalt IT community as your name was suggested and we think you are the kind of person we all would love to have as part of our community. This means you're independent-minded, technology-focused, community-oriented, and a thought leader in the area of IT infrastructure. </blockquote>

<p>Of course, this is pretty much hogwash, but nevertheless I&rsquo;m extremely honored to be invited as a delegate for <a href="http://gestaltit.com/field-day/tfd6/">Tech Field Day #6</a> in <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/">Boston, Mass</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully I have a very understanding employer (and wife!) that pretty much immediately gave the go ahead and let me take a few days off work to attend.</p>

<p>Looking at the delegate list, it&rsquo;s certain that I&rsquo;ll be in extremely good company for the event, and there is a good chance we will be able to do some <a href="http://vsoup.net/">vSoup</a> Live action while in Boston!</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sfoskett">Stephen Foskett</a> and the rest of <a href="http://gestaltit.com/">Gestalt IT</a> community who voted me in as a delegate, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re as surprised as I am.</p>

<p><strong>Look out Boston, the Delegates They Are A-Coming!</strong></p>
