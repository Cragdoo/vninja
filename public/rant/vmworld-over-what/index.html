  <p>Another VMworld US is over, with huge attendee numbers and in keeping with tradition lots of <a href="http://www.viktorious.nl/2014/09/01/vmworld-2014-announcements/">new announcements</a> were made.  I&rsquo;m not going to go through them, enough posts have been made about that, the basis of this post is something completely different all together.</p>

<p>There seems to be a general expectation that we as a community is to be wooed by the announcements and flashy keynotes, but are we really the target audience? If you think about it, we probably aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>While we certainly like to think that we are the center of the universe, there is no factual evidence available to back that up.</p>

<p>I think a lot of us who work for vendors, partners or even competitors seem to forget is that we live and breathe this stuff on a daily basis, and for the most part we actually have a pretty good idea what is going to be announced, and why. We participate in beta programs and in general have our fingers on the pulse <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>, and still we expect to have general announcements cater to our own perceived reality. A reality that in many cases are years ahead of the real targets; the end users and customers. The announcements made at a conference like VMworld serve more than one purpose, but the main purpose is to generate buzz and interest in new products and services.</p>

<p>We can talk about Software Defined Data Centers, with all its bells and whistles until we run out of breath. We can talk about All-Flash-Arrays and sub-millisecond latency until we turn blue, or proclaim that DevOps is the only true way to enlightenment, but is that the reality that our customers live in day to day? For the most part, I really don&rsquo;t think that is the case. New product announcements, new services and new buzzwords has an effect, it generates revenue down the line when the customers and end-users in the real world catch up with the bleeding edge reality we as tech-oligarks live in.</p>

<blockquote>Reality

The state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them.</blockquote>

<p>You may say <em>&ldquo;I reject your reality and substitute my own&rdquo;,</em> but that doesn&rsquo;t help us in any way, shape or form. We are fortunate enough to live on the very bleeding edge of technology and we are actually in a position to help change the direction it takes in the future.</p>

<p>Spend a minute and reflect on that. It&rsquo;s kinda neat isn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t stop pushing the boundaries of what we can do, and how, just take a break now and then and put your ear on the tracks and listen. A train might be on it&rsquo;s way, don&rsquo;t get hit by it just because you didn&rsquo;t bother checking.</p>
