  <p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DigitalShip-chm-207x240.jpg" alt="" />Back in February 2011 I was invited, along with my IT Manager, to do a presentation at <a href="http://www.thedigitalship.com/conferences/scandinavia/scando_2011.shtml">Digital Ship Scandinavia 2011</a>.</p>

<p>Digital Ship magazine has now published an article based on what we presented at the live event. As far as I can gather, based on the feedback both at the event and afterwards, the presentation was a success and now the Digital Ship Magazine for April 2011 includes a two page article based on the entire presentation.</p>

<p>I was not aware that they would do this, if so I clearly would have changed the the misconceptions in the &ldquo;<em>For installation we use the VMware Hypervisor on Windows Server 2008 R2 and put a Virtual Machine on top of that</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;quote&rdquo;, since that is wrong on several levels. Other than that, the article highlights all the important take-away points from our presentation, so if you&rsquo;re interested in managing and installing IT infrastructures on remote and floating locations, have a read!</p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://bit.ly/gb6U8J">Digital Ship Magazine April 2011</a>, and have a look at page 10-13 for the article called &ldquo;<strong>From &lsquo;lightly chaotic&rsquo; to strictly standardised - onboard networks</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
