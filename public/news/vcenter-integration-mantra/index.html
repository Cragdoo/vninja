<p>During <a href="http://techfieldday.com/2011/tfd6/">Tech Field Day #6 in Boston</a> one particular general feature request has become increasingly prominent;</p>

<p><strong>Can we have it inside the vCenter client?</strong></p>

<p>In short, what we want is for all those great third party vendors like <a href="http://www.vkernel.com/">VKernel</a>, <a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/">Solarwinds</a> and others to be able to put their feature addons directly into the vCenter client. Currently most third party apps &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; by offering a new tab where you can access it, but I would love to see that being expanded even further.</p>

<p>As a concrete example, I would love to see for instance VKernel identify performance problems for a VM and then tell me, inside the summary tab for that VM that there is a problem. Show it to me where I do my work, which is in vCenter, and mostly on the summary screen. Dashboards are great, but we&rsquo;re all suffering from dashboarditis, and the more disparate dashboards and tabs we get to have relations with, the less we&rsquo;re actually able to use them properly.</p>

<p>Also, raise a vCenter alert to leverage my existing alerting scheme to get my attention. If a 3rd party plugin sees that something is wrong, tell me through the existing infrastructure I already have in place. No need to reinvent the wheel each and every time, from each and every vendor.</p>

<p>Couple that with my back-end user authentication (eg. Active Directory) for sign-on into your solution, and we&rsquo;re getting much closer to the &ldquo;single pane of glass&rdquo; nirvana scenario we&rsquo;re all craving.</p>

<p>From what I gather the vCenter client (I am in no way, shape or form a developer), doesn&rsquo;t allow this level of integration on the VM summary screen right now but VMware needs to make it possible in the future.</p>

<p><strong>We admins want this, and we need it, and frankly, I think we deserve it (and so does the 3rd party vendors contributing to this ecosystem).</strong></p>
