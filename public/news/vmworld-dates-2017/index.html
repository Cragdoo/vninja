  <p>Now that the seasons have changed, it&rsquo;s time to look at 2017 and start planning the year.
First up, when is VMworld 2017, and  perhaps most importantly where? There has been a lot of speculation about this, and the perhaps strongest rumour was that it was moving to Berlin.</p>

<p>The details for the US has already been posted on <a href="http://vmworld.com">vmworld.com</a>, but for Europe all it says is &ldquo;Fall&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2016/11/18/change-dates-vmworld-europe-now-september-11th-14th/">According to Duncan</a>, which usually is in the know, VMworld Europe 2017 will once again be in Barcelona, but in September instead of October. The venue is yet to be announced, so here might be a change from the Fira. <strong>Update: The venue in Barcelona has now been confirmed at Fira Gran Via as per usual.</strong></p>

<p><strong>VMworld 2017 US </strong>
August 27 – August 31
Las Vegas | Mandalay Bay Hotel &amp; Convention Center</p>

<p><strong>VMworld 2017 Europe</strong>
September 11 – September 14
Barcelona | Fira Gran Via</p>

<p>So there it is, block those dates in your calendar, and start working on getting permission and funding now. Budgets for 2017 are being finalised now, so it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to get your request in early.</p>
