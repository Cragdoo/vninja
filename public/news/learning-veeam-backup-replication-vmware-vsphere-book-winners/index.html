<blockquote>Wow nice to see a book come out for Veeam. Look forward to the following things from this book to help better my Veeam skills -
Install and manage a Veeam® Backup & Replication v7 infrastructure
Discover how to back up and restore data in virtual environments
Utilize WAN acceleration to speed up backup to remote locations
Understand what options are available for Veeam® Backup & Replication, and how to configure these options
These topics will help further my skills with Veeam. Hopefully I win the book too.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Being new to Veeam, it’s nice to see a book dedicated to it. There aren’t many VMware books associated with third-party products.
I also see it’s written by this fella named Christian Mohn of vSoup and vCommunity fame. This is the biggest selling point of the book in my opinion.
But if I were to explain why I’d like a copy of the book based on its contents, I’d say that it’s sure to be an excellent primer on Veeam Backup and Replication. Since I’ve never used it before, I’d be left to stumble around the interface in a test lab to figure out how to use it without a guide like this. I glean a lot from reading (hands on, too, of course) and this book would probably help me learn the product in the shortest amount of time possible.
Thanks,

Mike</blockquote>

<blockquote>I am looking forward to getting more WAN-accel information as well as the U-AIR capability. Both topics are of high interest for an upcoming project!</blockquote>

<p>Congratulations, and I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy the book!</p>
