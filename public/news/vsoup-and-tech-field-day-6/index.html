  <p><a href="http://vsoup.net/2011/05/vsoup-raw-10/">vSoup Episode #10</a> is finally released, this time with <a href="http://twitter.com/vinternals">Stuart Radnidge</a> (<a href="http://blog.vinternals.com/">blog</a>) as our guest. This episode is a bit unusual, as we didn&rsquo;t really have a set agenda before starting the recording, so we jump around all of the place covering a pretty wide area of topics. Be sure to check it out!</p>

<p><a href="http://techfieldday.com/2011/tfd6/">Tech Field Day #6</a> is approaching really fast, in fact it&rsquo;s only a week away now! I will leave for Boston on Tuesday, June 7, for what looks to be a very, very busy but fun couple of days. I don&rsquo;t know what to expect, but <a href="https://twitter.com//ChrisDearden">Chris Dearden </a>has warned be that I probably won&rsquo;t be idle much.</p>

<p>This is the first Tech Field Day event that solely focuses on virtualization and the presenter list looks really promising:</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>In addition to these, there is a couple of more presenters that have not been announced yet. I&rsquo;ve met a few of the other delegates before, but the majority of them will be new acquaintances!</p>

<p>Since the entire vSoup crew is going across the pond, we&rsquo;ll try to get some live vSoup recordings done during the event!</p>

<p>The delegates will also be attending the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1716027685">VMunderground BPaaS (Beantown Party as a Service): Tech Field Day 6 Edition</a>, so if  you are in Boston on Thursday 9th of June, be sure to get a ticket and stop by and say hi!</p>
