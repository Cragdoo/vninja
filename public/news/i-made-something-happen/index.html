  <p>I think <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> might have been onto something with &ldquo;Make something happen&rdquo;, so I did.</p>

<p>Today was my last day at <a href="http://evry.no">EVRY</a>. Some might already have been aware of this, mostly because of <a href="https://twitter.com/Beaker/status/704375129485156352">Hoff-Job-Announcement-as-a-Service</a>, but also because of my own tweet as I left the EVRY offices in Bergen  as an employee for the last time:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/h0bbel/status/715526670254473217">https://twitter.com/h0bbel/status/715526670254473217</a></p>

<p>The decision to leave EVRY was not an easy one, but it was time to try something else. I have nothing but respect for both company and my now former colleagues and I&rsquo;m certain EVRY will continue it&rsquo;s mission to become the Nordic IT champion, and I&rsquo;m also certain they will succeed.</p>

<p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PROACT_logo_red_300dpi-300x56.jpg" alt="PROACT_logo_red_300dpi" /></p>

<p>My new role is as a _Senior Systems Architect _for <a href="http://proact.no">Proact IT Norge</a>, with a focus on VMware&rsquo;s SDDC stack. What that _really _means, remains to be defined, but I&rsquo;m excited to start this new endeavour and be given an opportunity to help <a href="http://proact.no">Proact</a> **design the data centres of the future. **Proact recently also won a <a href="http://www.proact.no/Om_oss/nyheter/News-Detail/?releaseid=1118698">Global VMware Innovation Award for 2016</a>, so I guess I&rsquo;m at the right place at the right time when I now join <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teamproact&amp;src=typd">#teamproact</a>.</p>

<p>So, in the words of Jake and Elwood:</p>

<blockquote>**Elwood:** It's 106 miles to Chicago, we got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark...  and we're wearing sunglasses.
**Jake:** Hit it.</blockquote>
