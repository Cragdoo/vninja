  <p>Some times things just happen, and before you know it you&rsquo;re sitting in your in-laws living room talking to an Englishman and an American via Skype. And to top it of; it&rsquo;s all being recorded. And to make matters even worse, we decided to try and make it a regular thing. The recordings that is, not the &ldquo;in your in-laws living room&rdquo; thing, that was a one-off for sure.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say here is that yours truly, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/eczerwin">Ed Czerwin</a> and <a href="http://jfvi.co.uk/">Chris Dearden</a> has decided that we want to be rock-stars and start our own little virtualization related podcast.</p>

The first episode of vSoup is now available, head on over to <a href="http://vSoup.net">vSoup.net</a> to check it out, and remember, we are all virgins here. Be gentle.</p>
