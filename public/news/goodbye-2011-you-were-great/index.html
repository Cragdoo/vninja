<p>Yes, this is YAEotYP, so if you&rsquo;ve already read tons of them I apologize.</p>

<h3 id="2011-my-personal-view">2011 - My personal view</h3>

<p>2011 has been a steamroller of a year.The <a href="http://vSoup.net">vSoup Virtualization Podcast</a> got aired the first time, and we&rsquo;ve recorded and published 19 full episodes in the inaugural year. I was awarded the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/">vExpert</a> title for the first time, and even got invited to <a href="http://techfieldday.com/2011/tfd6/">Tech Field Day #6</a> in Boston.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I wrote a <a href="http://go.veeam.com/wp-2011-christian-mohn-7-expert-tips-managing-remote-vsphere.html">white paper for Veeam</a>, was included in the <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/server-virtualization/announcing-our-new-advisory-board-member/">Server Virtualization Advisory Board</a>, joined <a href="http://twitter.com/RickVanover">Rick Vanover</a> for a <a href="http://www.veeam.com/podcast/episode-45-%E2%80%93-vsphere-5-storage-potpourri.html">Veeam Community Podcast</a>, and appeared in two video interviews.</p>

<p>One with <a href="http://twitter.com/mike_laverick">Mike Laverick</a> about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO8qU_5JgB8">#VMTNSubscriptionMovement</a> and one where <a href="http://twitter.com/esloof">Eric Sloof</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnBi7A5xn88">ambushed me with a camera</a> while visiting Bergen.</p>

<p>Lots of exiting projects were started in 2011, including my <a href="http://vninja.net/virtualization/auto-installation-and-configuring-of-vsphere-esxi-5/">PowerCLI based automation project for vessel installations</a>, migrating from standalone ESX hosts to blade servers (HP c7000 + Virtual Connect/Flex10) in addition to the normal day to day operations and after 8 years at <a href="http://seatrans.no">Seatrans AS</a>, I handed in my papers, moving on to a <a href="http://vninja.net/news/my-personal-vmotion/">new role for EDB ErgoGroup</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2011-vninja-net-statistics">2011 vNinja.net Statistics</h3>

<p>2011 was the first year this site existed, so I can&rsquo;t really compare the traffic it has received with 2010, but based on the few months it existed in 2010 the traffic increase has been enormous.</p>

And that&rsquo;s it for 2011. Personally 2012 looks even more promising, and hopefully my exposure to more diverse environments should be reflected back on the site as I&rsquo;m certain it will spur more posts and more interesting discussions. See you in 2012, I think we&rsquo;re in for a cracker.
