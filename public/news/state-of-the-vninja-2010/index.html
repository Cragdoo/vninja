  <p>Is 2010 over already? I guess it&rsquo;s true that time flies when your having fun! 2010 has been a great year for me, both personally and professionally. I won&rsquo;t bore you to death with personal issues, but as far as professionally goes you&rsquo;ll just have to bare with me.</p>

<p>2010 was the year I really feel that I got a lot of good work done, and some of that are really significant changes for my organization which is in a way better state IT wise now than in 2009. I can&rsquo;t take credit for all that on my own, I have some very competent coworkers that are equally to blame/praise for the work we have been able to do in 2010. By the looks of it, 2011 will be even better!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5074303313_df322ab659_m.jpg" alt="" />One major thing stands out when I think of what happened the last 12 months. <a href="http://vninja.net/virtualization/vmworld-europe-2010the-aftermath/">VMworld Europe 2010</a>. It still amazes me how important VMworld feels, even 4 months later. I met some amazing people face to face, finally, and that alone was worth the trip. You know who you are!</p>

<p>I had one, albeit pretty minor, public speaking job in 2010 where I did a walk-trough of my companies disaster recovery setup, based on, amongst other things, VMware vSphere and Veeam Backup and Recovery. I haven&rsquo;t done any of that in a while, and it was real fun being asked to do it again. Hopefully there will be more opportunities to do more of the same, and by the looks of it I might even do a similar, but much bigger, gig again in the beginning of February 2011. More details to come.</p>

<p>I have set a lot of personal goals for 2011, and I won&rsquo;t be listing them all here as some of them are pretty personal. But I do have a plan for finally getting my VCP4 sorted, and possibly also a <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=16548&amp;ui=www_cert&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">VCAP-DCA</a> if my employer gives the go-ahead. I have been neglecting these certifications for way to long now.</p>

<p>I do promise to keep posting on vNinja, and I really promise to finish off a series of posts when I start publishing them! Sadly I didn&rsquo;t manage to get all my stuff sorted before the end of the year, but hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to finish the series I&rsquo;ve started on pretty early in 2011.</p>

<p>vNinja saw a total of 32 posts in 2010, the first one in late July. This equates to about 5 posts a month, something I look to increase on in 2011. The visitor numbers have been amazingly good, and I hope to keep building on that as well.</p>

<p>And who knows, you might just <em>hear</em> more from me in 2011 than ever before. How do you like your bowl of vSoup?</p>

<p>While I can promise to meet all my goals for 2011, I can promise one thing: <em>There will be no seppuku in 2011, neither physical nor virtual. I&rsquo;m here for the long haul, like it or not.</em></p>

<p>Have a good new year everyone, I&rsquo;m honored to have you as my readers and I&rsquo;ll work hard to keep it that way throughout 2011 as well.</p>
