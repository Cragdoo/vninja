  <p>Every <a href="http://www.edbergogroup.com/"><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/EDB_ErgoGroup.gif" alt="" /></a> once in a while an opportunity  presents itself that is just too good to pass up and after 8 years at <a href="http://www.seatrans.no">Seatrans AS</a>  I&rsquo;ve decided to move on and and accept a position as a Senior Consultant in the Infrastructure Consulting division of <a href="http://www.edbergogroup.com/">EDB ErgoGroup</a>.</p>

<p>Seatrans has been a fantastic employer, and without the backing and support I&rsquo;ve had over the years I would not be in a position where this change would be possible. It was with mixed emotions I handed in my notice, but I&rsquo;m 100% certain that this is the right move, at the right time, for me personally.</p>

<p>As a consultant my main focus will still be virtualization in general, and VMware solutions in particular. The upside to this is that I will definitely be able to work even more with the technology closest to my heart, and with a larger team that has a similar passion for technology. Moving back to the consultant side of the table should be an interesting challenge, and one that I&rsquo;m really looking forward to.</p>

<p>The blog will stay the same, perhaps this change might even bring more content in as I&rsquo;m going to be exposed to a lot of different infrastructures and challenges.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also set a couple of pretty hefty personal goals for 2012, but I&rsquo;ll keep those to myself until I see how everything pans out.</p>

<p><strong>2012? Bring your A game, because I&rsquo;m awake, strong and ready!</strong></p>
