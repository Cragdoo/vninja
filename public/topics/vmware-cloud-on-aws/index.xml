      <description>VMware vSAN utilizing Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) is an interesting one. Being able to independently increment storage in the VMC without adding compute nodes is a feature that has been missing, until now.
Customers of VMware Cloud on AWS will now be able to scale storage independently of compute, by adding new EBS storage nodes.
Overview R5.Metal Physical Host Configuration  ​3 disk groups per host All storage provided by EBS GP2 Raw capacity tier of 15-35TB  Configured at Cluster creation 5TB increments ​Compression Enabled      Item Available     CPU Skylake-SP   Sockets per Host 2   Cores per Socket 24   Cores per Host 48   Threads per Host 96   Memory 768 GB   Storage EBS GP2   NICs 1 x ENA    Note: This new storage cluster needs to be added to an existing SDDC and cannot be the first cluster that is provisioned in the customer environment.</description>
