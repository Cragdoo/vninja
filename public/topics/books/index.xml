      <description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in late 2014 I volunteered to do technical review for a book called **&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?keyWords=arrasjid&amp;amp;type=&#34;&gt;IT Architect: Foundation in the Art of Infrastructure Design: A Practical Guide for IT Architects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Due to a lot of unforeseen events, the book has been delayed quite a bit, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally available as hardcopy, paperback and eBook! The book is written byÂ &lt;/strong&gt;J**&lt;strong&gt;ohn Yani Arrasjid&lt;/strong&gt;, VCDX-001, &lt;strong&gt;Mark Gabryjelski&lt;/strong&gt;, VCDX-023, &lt;strong&gt;Chris McCain&lt;/strong&gt;, VCDX-079 and as the title states it really does lay out the foundation of how to approach infrastructure design in a modern virtualised data center.
