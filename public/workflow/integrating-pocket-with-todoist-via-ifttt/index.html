<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mylesagray/status/922783625241866241">Myles Gray</a> asked me how I integrate Pocket with Todoist, after my <a href="http://vninja.net/workflow/how-i-use-todoist/">How I use Todoist</a> post, and the answer is very simple: <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>. If-This-Then-That lets you connect services, and create rules (or applets) that trigger based on events in those services, luckily both Todoist and Pocket are supported.</p>

<p>Now, there is a bit of overlap between how I use Pocket and Todoist, but I mainly use Pocket to keep track of links I want to either read later, or use as basis for blog posts.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_4807&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;644&rdquo;]<a href="https://unsplash.com/@karishea"><img src="/img/kari-shea-199320-644x429.jpg" alt="" /></a> Photo by Kari Shea on Unsplash[/caption]</p>

<p>I have two main IFTTT recipes that takes care of my integration between the two. Both of these use Pocket as the source, and Todoist as the target, I do not transfer anything <em>from</em> Todoist <em>to</em> Pocket.</p>

<h2 id="ifft-applets"><strong>IFFT Applets:</strong></h2>

<h3 id="if-new-item-tagged-read-then-create-a-task-in-to-read"><strong>&ldquo;If new item tagged read, then create a task in To Read&rdquo;</strong></h3>

<p>Simply put, if I tag something with the tag <strong>read</strong> in Pocket, it gets added to my &ldquo;<em>To Read</em>&rdquo; sub-project in Todoist. This allows me to quickly move a Pocket item into Todoist as an action item, with the complete URL. It does not assign a label, nor does it set a priority—but it allows me to have a nice link list in Todoist with items I want read later. Of course, the Todoist Chrome extension allows me to do similar things, but only from the browser. Since I use IFTTT to add my Twitter likes to Pocket etc, it makes sense to have most of that collected in one place for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="if-new-item-tagged-todo-then-create-a-task-in-inbox"><strong>&ldquo;If new item tagged todo, then create a task in Inbox&rdquo;</strong></h3>

<p>Similar to the one above, just with the <strong>todo</strong> tag instead. Naturally those links get placed in my &ldquo;To Do&rdquo; project instead. The difference here is that those that go into my To Do project, are things that I want to actively do something with (besides reading). That might be create a blog post based on something, send it to a client or coworker, or similar tasks.</p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>For me, Pocket works as a first repository of content I want to check out, and the content I want to do something further with, they live in Todoist. Once they are in Tooist, it&rsquo;s trival to move them over to the correct projects and/or labels for organizing.</p>

<p>I have also set up a recurring task, with mobile alerts, to make sure I check my Pocket-lint at least once a week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are other, and more fancy ways of doing this, or even improve on them. Please leave a comment if you do something similar, or something that I haven&rsquo;t even thought of at all.</p>
