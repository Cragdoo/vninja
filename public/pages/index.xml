      <description>Hey there, my name is Christian Mohn. Come say hello to me on Twitter! 
I live in Bergen, Norway, and I&amp;rsquo;m as old as the original Rocky movie. I currently work as a Senior Solutions Architect and Technical Lead SDDC for Proact IT Norge AS, working on building Norways best, and strongest, VMware SDDC practice, and I&amp;rsquo;m a strong believer in that software is indeed eating the world.</description>
