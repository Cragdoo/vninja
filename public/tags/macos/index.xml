      <description>When playing around with Royal TSX I needed to mass convert the VMware Clarity .svg files to .png files that I could use as icons in Royal TSX.
After trying a series of different approaches, I ended up with using rsvg-convert from libRSVG. In order to get rsvg-convert installed on my MacBook, I turned to HomeBrew.
HomeBrew, which calls itself The missing package manager for macOS is in my opinion essential for any macOS user.</description>

      <description>The VMware Cross vCenter VM Mobility - CLI was recently updated so I decided to try it out. In short, this little Java based application allows you to easily move or clone VMs between disparate vCenter environments.
The Fling is listed with the following requirements:
 JDK 1.7 or above
 Two vCenter instances with ESX 6.0
 Windows : Windows Server 2003 or above
 Linux : RHEL 7.x or above, Ubuntu 11.</description>

      <description>Working with the keyboard to move resize, focus and arrange your applications is a great productivity tip. When I changed from Windows to macOS a few years ago, I had a pretty convoluted setup based on Slate for managing keyboard shortcuts, especially for moving applications around, but this has since been simplified by using Spectacle instead of Slate.
Spectacle has everything I need, especially keyboard shortcuts for maximising an application, of &amp;ldquo;flinging&amp;rdquo; it over to another display.</description>

      <description>Since I set up a public jumphost for my homelab/network, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for an easy way to manage my SSH tunnels. After trying a couple of different managers, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to use Secure Pipes.This little piece of free software allows you to easily manage SSH tunnels, with features like Remote Forwards, Local Forwards and SOCKS proxies. It runs in the toolbar, and makes connections easily available. It even reconfigures your network settings to use the SOCKS proxy, if allowed to.</description>
