      <description>When playing around with Royal TSX I needed to mass convert the VMware Clarity .svg files to .png files that I could use as icons in Royal TSX.
After trying a series of different approaches, I ended up with using rsvg-convert from libRSVG. In order to get rsvg-convert installed on my MacBook, I turned to HomeBrew.
HomeBrew, which calls itself The missing package manager for macOS is in my opinion essential for any macOS user.</description>

      <title>How I use Todoist</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, I use Todoist to keep track of my personal to-do list. This is the first to-do manager I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to stick with, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it daily for well over 2 years now. In that two year period I&amp;rsquo;ve reorganised it a bit, but for the most part I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep to the main structure I initially created when setting it up the first time.</description>

      <title>Making Royal TSX Even More Awesome</title>

      <description>For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Royal TSX is an awesome Remote Management solution, which supports RDP, VNC, SSH, S/FTP and even ESXi and vCenter. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for years, not just because they offer free licenses for vExperts (and others), but simply because it works really well. Store it&amp;rsquo;s config file on a synchronized file area (like Dropbox), and boom, your config follows you around from machine to machine, including custom icons.</description>
