      <description>Howard Marks has published a post I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning do myself, but to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m glad Howard put it out there. His is way more researched and comprehensive than mine would ever have been.

But the idea that everyone should go hyperconverged and all data should be placed on local drives, even if made redundant inside the chassis and even between chassis, is to be blunt, a bit silly.</description>
