      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer of mine, who runs a pure HP environment based on c7000 and StoreServ 7200, wanted to get the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A93zVmnheEE&#34;&gt;HP Insight Control Storage Module for vCenter&lt;/a&gt; up and running. The problem was that while we were able to connect to the older MSA array they run for non-production workloads, we were unable to connect to the newer StoreServ 7200. There is full IP connectivity between the application server that the HP Insight components run on and the storage controllers/VSP (no firewalls between them, they are located in the same subnet).
