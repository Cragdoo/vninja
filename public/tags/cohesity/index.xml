      <description>A few weeks back Cohesity gave me access to a lab environment, where I could play around with their HyperConverged Secondary Data solution. For those unaware of their offering entails, it&amp;rsquo;s simply put a solution for managing secondary storage. In this case, secondary storage is really everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t mission critical. It can be your backups, test/dev workloads, file shares and so on . The idea to place these unstructured data sets on a secondary storage platform, to ease management and analytics but at the same time keep it integrated with the rest of the existing environment.</description>
