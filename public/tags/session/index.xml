      <description>VMware has opened the public voting for the VMworld 2011 sessions. Personally I haven&amp;rsquo;t submitted anything, but I do see a lot of familiar names in the voting application.
The voting is available to anyone who has a vmworld.com account, and the voting period is from May 9th to May 18th. The voting is global, which means a vote for a session counts as a vote for both VMworld US and VMworld EMEA as 80% of the selected sessions will occur at both events.</description>
