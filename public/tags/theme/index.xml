      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have given the site a small facelift, replacing the old theme with a new and cleaner version. For some reason, I get this &amp;laquo;theme itch&amp;raquo; a couple of times a year, but usually I manage to let it pass without doing many changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time it stuck with me though, and ended up with replacing the old theme with a new one. In fact, the old theme had been active for close to two years now, so it was time to shake things up a bit any way. The new theme gives the site a fresh and in my opinion better look. The double menus in the header makes it look more organised, and less cluttered and the static navigation header is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to have for a long time now.&lt;/p&gt;
