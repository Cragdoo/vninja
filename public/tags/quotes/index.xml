      <title>Random VCDX Tips and Quotes?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vNinja-Labs.png&#34; alt=&#34;vNinja-Labs&#34; /&gt;I needed something to spruce up my desktop environment, and it seems that one of the more popular ways to do that is to display random quotes and such on your desktop. Instead of hooking up to an existing quotes database, I simply made my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have collected a few VCDX related tips and quotes, primarily from the archive &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/DuncanYB&#34;&gt;Duncan Epping&lt;/a&gt; put together of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/10/01/vcdx-tips-from-vcdx-001-john-arrasjid/&#34;&gt;VCDX Tips from VCDX 001 John Arrasjid&lt;/a&gt;, but also from the &amp;laquo;submissions&amp;raquo; I got from &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/vcdx-give-quote/&#34;&gt;VCDX? Give Me a Quote!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If anyone else wants their quote/tip/hint added to the database, please let me know!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>For a tiny project, I need some help from anyone who has completed (successfully or not) the VCDX process.
_All I&amp;rsquo;m asking is that you provide me with a single line quote about the VCDX process, or the VCDX program itself. _
Please send any quotes to me on Twitter, either as a mention or as a DM, your choice. Once I have a handful of quotes available, they will be made public for others to use as well&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As the title says, it&amp;rsquo;s been one of my more &amp;laquo;public&amp;raquo; weeks ever. Besides my &amp;laquo;normal&amp;raquo; vSoup engagement, this week I&amp;rsquo;ve also been involved with Mike Laverick&amp;rsquo;s VMTN Subscription Movement Miniwags to voice some of my views about the #VMTNSubscriptionMovement.
Fair warning: This is video, and please to remember that during recording Movember was nearing its final phase. VMTN Subscription Movement Miniwags – Christian Mohn
Secondly, I was a guest on the Veeam Community Podcast Episode 45 – vSphere 5 Storage Potpourri.</description>
