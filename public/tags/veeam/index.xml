      <title>Veeam vCenter Migration Utility</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/virtualization/veeam-vcenter-migration-utility/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2016 09:35:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/veeam-vcenter-migration-utility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in 2013, I published &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/preserve-veeam-br-backups-jobs-moving-vcenter/&#34;&gt;Preserve your Veeam B&amp;amp;R Backups Jobs when Moving vCenter&lt;/a&gt;, outlining how to &amp;laquo;cheat&amp;raquo; (by using a CNAME alias) to preserve your Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication jobs if you replace your VMware vCenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when there is a new vCenter instance, all the Virtual Machine Managed Object Reference&amp;rsquo;s (MoRef) change, which makes Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication start a new backup/replication chain, since all VMs are treated as new ones. Not ideal by any means, but at least you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to recreate all your jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

I am thrilled to be selected amongst the first 31 people awarded this title, it&amp;rsquo;s quite an exclusive list!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Veeam Backup &amp; Replication 8: RPC error:Access is denied Fix</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/virtualization/veeam-backup-replication-8-rpc-erroraccess-denied-fix/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/veeam-backup-replication-8-rpc-erroraccess-denied-fix/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently set up a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html&#34;&gt;Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication v8&lt;/a&gt; demo lab, and my intial small job that consisted of two different Linux VMs and one Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller was chugging along nicely. I had one minor from the start though, and that was that file indexing consistently failed for the Windows VM. No big deal, but I thought it was strange at the time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Backing up vCenter DB with Veeam B&amp;R 6.5</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/virtualization/backing-up-vcenter-db-with-veeam-br-6-5/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2013 09:03:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/backing-up-vcenter-db-with-veeam-br-6-5/</guid>
      <description>It´s a well known problem that with Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Recovery Replication 6.5, and earlier, backing up the SQL server that hosts the vCenter DB poses a problem. KB1051 VSS for vCenter outlines the issue well, and provides a workaround.
If you experience this problem, you will see entries like this in your Veeam B&amp;amp;R backup logs:
 Veeam vCenterDB Backup Error
The workaround provided by Veeam is to create host VM-Host Affinity Rules, effectively pinning a VM to a given host, and then perform the VM backup through the host rather than through the vCenter.</description>

      <description>This week I´m working at a client site, upgrading their entire existing vSphere 4.1 infrastructure to vSphere 5.1. The customer engagement also includes upgrading Veeam Backup and Replication 6.0 to 6.5, and usually an isolated upgrade of Veeam B&amp;amp;R is a no-brainer next, next, next, done install.
To complicate things in this particular environment, I also had to migrate the vCenter SQL DB from a local MS SQL Server 2005 Express instance to a full-fledged MS SQL Server 2008 R2 instance.</description>

      <description>As the title says, it&amp;rsquo;s been one of my more &amp;laquo;public&amp;raquo; weeks ever. Besides my &amp;laquo;normal&amp;raquo; vSoup engagement, this week I&amp;rsquo;ve also been involved with Mike Laverick&amp;rsquo;s VMTN Subscription Movement Miniwags to voice some of my views about the #VMTNSubscriptionMovement.
Fair warning: This is video, and please to remember that during recording Movember was nearing its final phase. VMTN Subscription Movement Miniwags – Christian Mohn
Secondly, I was a guest on the Veeam Community Podcast Episode 45 – vSphere 5 Storage Potpourri.</description>

      <title>Backup Academy - Do You Know Your VM backups?</title>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/backup-academy-do-you-know-your-vm-backups/</guid>
      <description>The newly opened Backup Academy, by Veeam, aims to educate administrators, and others interested in virtual machine backup, in the required skills to maintain a proper backup strategy for your virtual infrastructure.
Currently the site has 8 videos available, covering content from disaster recovery to backup integrity tools.
Even if it is run by Veeam, it does not focus on Veeam specific products or services, but rather on the general ideas behind a successful backup and disaster recovery of both VMware and Hyper-V based environments.</description>

      <title>7 Expert Tips for Managing Your Remote vSphere Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/news/7-expert-tips-for-managing-your-remote-vsphere-infrastructure/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/news/7-expert-tips-for-managing-your-remote-vsphere-infrastructure/</guid>
      <description>Now there is a catchy title if I ever saw one. Only &amp;laquo;problem&amp;raquo; is that it&amp;rsquo;s a whitepaper that I have written for Veeam. In reality this is the first published article I have ever written, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish on my own. I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it, yet strangely nervous about how it will be received by the people who download it. If you happen to do so, make sure to let me know how you found it, all comments and criticism will be most appreciated.</description>

      <description>Finally USB pass-through is possible on ESX hosts with the new vSphere 4.1 release! This feature ha been available in VMware Workstation/Fusion and Player for quite a while. The freshly added feature in vSphere 4.1 even works if you vMotion the guest from one host to another, which is in itself pretty amazing functionality!
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to setup and use the new USB pass-through feature in vSphere 4.</description>
