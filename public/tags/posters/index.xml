      <description>I needed some new wall &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo; for my home office, and decided that a couple of small &amp;ldquo;Keep Calm&amp;rdquo; posters would do the trick. Naturally I got a bit carried away, and created more than one, and of course, most of them are virtualization related:
[gallery ids=&amp;ldquo;2412,2413,2414,2415,2416,2417,2418,2422,2424,2425,2427,2429,2431,2441,2444,2446,2452,2455,2459,2460,2461,2463,2469,2471,2476,2480,2483,2485,2487,2499,2511,2512,2547,2572,2575&amp;rdquo; orderby=&amp;ldquo;rand&amp;rdquo;]
If you have some ideas, IÂ´ll gladly create more, just leave a comment! I would also love photos if you printed out any of these and put them on a wall or in a frame somewhere.</description>
