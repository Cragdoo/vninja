      <description>The 2016 Nordic VMUG UserCon in Copenhagen, Denmark, is just 11 days away, and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t registered already now is the time to do so. As usual the speaker lineup for the event is awesome, with a lot of the usual suspects like Duncan Epping (VMware), Cormac Hogan (VMware), Lee Dilworth (VMware), and Frank Denneman (VMware), but VMware is also showing it&amp;rsquo;s commitment to VMUG by sending some non-europeans as well, like Grant Orchard and_ Mike Foley_.</description>
