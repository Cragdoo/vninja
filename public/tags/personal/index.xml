      <description>Last year, in January, I posted 2015: Let&amp;rsquo;s DOS IT! and it&amp;rsquo;s time to do some reviewing (again, inspired by Scott Lowe).
So, how did I do?  Master Markdown: I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that most of the writing I&amp;rsquo;ve done in 2015 has been done in Markdown. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really moved on to really create Markdown based documentation and convert it like I intended, but still, Markdown has become second nature in 2015.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Scott Lowe&amp;rsquo;s Looking Ahead: My 2015 Projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do something similar.
Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t post anything like this in 2014, I can&amp;rsquo;t really go back and see how my plans turned out, or provide any assessement of it. I can say this though, 2014 was pretty awesome. I got a promotion, my vExpert status was renewed, vNinja was voted in the top 50 of the 2014 top VMware &amp;amp; virtualization vote, I published a book and finally got the Norwegian VMUG up and running.</description>

      <description>Every  once in a while an opportunity presents itself that is just too good to pass up and after 8 years at Seatrans AS I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move on and and accept a position as a Senior Consultant in the Infrastructure Consulting division of EDB ErgoGroup.
Seatrans has been a fantastic employer, and without the backing and support I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years I would not be in a position where this change would be possible.</description>
