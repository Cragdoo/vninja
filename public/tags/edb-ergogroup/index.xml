      <description>Every  once in a while an opportunity presents itself that is just too good to pass up and after 8 years at Seatrans AS I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move on and and accept a position as a Senior Consultant in the Infrastructure Consulting division of EDB ErgoGroup.
Seatrans has been a fantastic employer, and without the backing and support I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years I would not be in a position where this change would be possible.</description>
