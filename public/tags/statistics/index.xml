2011 - My personal view 2011 has been a steamroller of a year.The vSoup Virtualization Podcast got aired the first time, and we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded and published 19 full episodes in the inaugural year. I was awarded the vExpert title for the first time, and even got invited to Tech Field Day #6 in Boston.
In addition to this, I wrote a white paper for Veeam, was included in the Server Virtualization Advisory Board, joined Rick Vanover for a Veeam Community Podcast, and appeared in two video interviews.</description>
