      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a part of my&lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/&#34;&gt; Homelab&lt;/a&gt; project, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a proper bash script to provide dynamic DNS updates for external resources, via CloudFlare. More details on the reasoning behind it can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/using-cloudflare-for-dynamic-dns/&#34;&gt;Using CloudFlare for Dynamic DNS&lt;/a&gt;, but since that was posted I&amp;rsquo;ve fleshed the script out quite a bit more.

      <title>Using CloudFlare for Dynamic DNS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/dynamic-dns-requirements/&#34;&gt;In my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I tried to lay out the foundation and reasoning behind requiring a Dynamic DNS Service, and here is how I solved it using CloudFlare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I moved my chosen domain name to CloudFlare, and made sure everything resolved ok with static records. Once that was working, I started playing around with the CloudFlare API, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/&#34;&gt;Cocoa Rest Client&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no developer (as is probably very apparent by the script below), nor API wizard of any kind, but it was fairly easy figuring out how to craft a request that lists my DNS zone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic DNS Requirements</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on my new &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/taking-it-to-far/&#34;&gt;Homelab&lt;/a&gt; setup, I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating ways to provide hostname based access to several web services located in my DMZ zone. Since my provider doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide static IP addresses, I also need an external Dynamic DNS service, to provide said hostname mappings through the reverse proxy on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are loads of Dynamic DNS services available, most of them lets you use some sort of predefined domain name scheme, and point it to your external IP, but I wanted to use a domain name that I own and control. Since I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudflare.com&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; to provide DNS services (amongst other things) for this very site, it was a natural choice to see if they could fit the bill for my lab needs as well. Turns out, not only can they provide the services I need for free, they also allow me to play around and have fun at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applescript, Desktop Wallpaper and Growl. Automagically.</title>

      <description>I´ve been a Mac and OS X user now for about 7 months, but to be honest I have not been very experimental in my usage of my Macbook Air. Until now, my main focus has been basic usage of the hardware and operating systems, and making it work in my corporate environment. As I feel that I´ve reached mission accomplished status on that initial project, I decided to use some of my &amp;laquo;free&amp;raquo; vacation time to play around a bit and experiment a bit more.</description>
