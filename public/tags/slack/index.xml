      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Slack to alert and log a few things in my environment, and one of the things I use it for is to alert me if someone logs on via SSH to my public facing Jumphost.
For a good walkthrough on how to set up such a host, check out Tunnel all your remote connections through ssh with a linux jumpbox by Luca Dell&amp;rsquo;Oca.
My Ubuntu 16.04 Jumphost is set up to only accept Key-Based Authentication, to secure it as much as possible, but I would still like to get instant notification if someone logs into it interactively.</description>

      <description>Just like Lior Kamrat I&amp;rsquo;ve set up my own private Slack for messaging and alerting from various services running both in my lab and some external facing services. It&amp;rsquo;s only been running a few days, but so far it works brilliantly and helps me keep track.
So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up Slack alerting and/or integrations for the following items:
