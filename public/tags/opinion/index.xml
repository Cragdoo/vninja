      <description>Another VMworld US is over, with huge attendee numbers and in keeping with tradition lots of new announcements were made. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go through them, enough posts have been made about that, the basis of this post is something completely different all together.
There seems to be a general expectation that we as a community is to be wooed by the announcements and flashy keynotes, but are we really the target audience?</description>

      <description>VMware Offers vCloud “Test-Drive” with New Evaluation Service.
This announcement doesn´t seem to be &amp;laquo;Project Zephyr&amp;raquo; which, if the rumors are true, is VMware´s own fully fledged IaaS service.
This Public vCloud “Test-Drive” service, which VMware themselves describe as “white-label” from a vCloud service provider, seems like a way for VMware to provide cheap test-drive access, to vCloud through their existing service providers.
Where the rumored &amp;laquo;Project Zephyr&amp;raquo; might be seen as a competing service, Public vCloud looks to be engineered to drive long term customers to the existing ecosystem of providers.</description>
