      <description>Duncan Epping rather unceremoniously published a blog post &amp;ldquo;New Beta Program offering: VMware Hosted Beta&amp;rdquo; yesterday, outlining the availability of the new hosted beta offering that companions some of the current VMware beta programs.

The VMware Hosted Beta runs on the same engine that runs the VMware Hands on Labs Online – Beta, but with a little added twist.</description>

At the moment, the available labs are:Cloud Infrastructure:  HOL-INF-02 - Explore vSphere 5.1 Distributed Switch (vDS) New Features This lab explores the new features of the vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS).</description>
