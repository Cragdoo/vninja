      <description>About a year and a half I go, I took the leap from running Microsoft Windows as my main operating system and switched into full &amp;ldquo;hipster mode&amp;rdquo;, i.e. switched to a Macbook Air and OS X.
Simply put, &amp;ldquo;the change&amp;rdquo; was not that hard and most everything has worked without problems, and for those things that still require Microsoft Windows, well, there is VMware Fusion for that.
While I´m admittedly still a novice OS X user, and not even close to mastering OS X, I´d like to share my current Slate setup.</description>
