      <description>Watchguard has recently retired their X series of firewalls and replaced them with their new lineup of XTM boxes.
I took this opportunity to replace my X series firewalls with some from the new lineup, and found a neat way to migrate your existing configuration from old to new in a few very easy steps.

Note: _Normally I would not recommend migrating your configuration in this manner. In my mind you should always rebuild rules when replacing your firewall, as it is the perfect time to review and do some QA.</description>
