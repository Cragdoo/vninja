      <description>Dockerflix is a nice little project that allows you to route your Netflix (and other various streaming services) through a SNI Proxy to access content otherwise geo-blocked. Of course, this requires that you have a VM with for instance an US IP to provide the breakout network, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Ravello Systems comes into the equation. Luckily as a current vExpert I have access to 1000 free monthly CPU hours of personal/lab usage, all with a choice of regions to put the VM in.</description>

      <description>RavelloSystems has announced free lab service for all 2015 vExperts, which offers 1,000 free CPU hours per month for personal or home lab use.
I was lucky enough to be one of the early VMware on AWS VIP Pass users, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on several setups the last few weeks. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make those available as blueprints in the new Ravello Repo, once they are ready for publishing.</description>
