      <description>I needed some new wall &amp;laquo;art&amp;raquo; for my home office, and decided that a couple of small &amp;laquo;Keep Calm&amp;raquo; posters would do the trick. Naturally I got a bit carried away, and created more than one, and of course, most of them are virtualization related:
If you have some ideas, IÂ´ll gladly create more, just leave a comment! I would also love photos if you printed out any of these and put them on a wall or in a frame somewhere.</description>
