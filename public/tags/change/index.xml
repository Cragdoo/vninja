      <description>I think Seth Godin might have been onto something with &amp;laquo;Make something happen&amp;raquo;, so I did.
Today was my last day at EVRY. Some might already have been aware of this, mostly because of Hoff-Job-Announcement-as-a-Service, but also because of my own tweet as I left the EVRY offices in Bergen as an employee for the last time:

The decision to leave EVRY was not an easy one,Â but it was time to try something else.</description>

      <description>Every  once in a while an opportunity presents itself that is just too good to pass up and after 8 years at Seatrans AS I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move on and and accept a position as a Senior Consultant in the Infrastructure Consulting division of EDB ErgoGroup.
Seatrans has been a fantastic employer, and without the backing and support I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years I would not be in a position where this change would be possible.</description>
