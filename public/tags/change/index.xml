      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; might have been onto something with &amp;laquo;Make something happen&amp;raquo;, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my last day at &lt;a href=&#34;http://evry.no&#34;&gt;EVRY&lt;/a&gt;. Some might already have been aware of this, mostly because of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Beaker/status/704375129485156352&#34;&gt;Hoff-Job-Announcement-as-a-Service&lt;/a&gt;, but also because of my own tweet as I left the EVRY offices in Bergen Â as an employee for the last time:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Every  once in a while an opportunity presents itself that is just too good to pass up and after 8 years at Seatrans AS I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move on and and accept a position as a Senior Consultant in the Infrastructure Consulting division of EDB ErgoGroup.
Seatrans has been a fantastic employer, and without the backing and support I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years I would not be in a position where this change would be possible.</description>
