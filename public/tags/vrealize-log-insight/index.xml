      <description>If you boot your ESXi hosts from SD-cards or USB you might have run into this issue. Suddenly your host(s) displays the following under events: &amp;ldquo;Bootbank cannot be found at path ‘/bootbank’.&amp;rdquo;
Usually this means that the boot device has been corrupted somehow, either due to a device failure or other issues. Normally the host continues to run, until it&amp;rsquo;s rebooted that is&amp;hellip;
For some reason, vRealize Operations doesn&amp;rsquo;t pick this up as a host issue that it alerts on, so if your alerting regime is based on vROps alerts, you might not get alerted immediately.</description>
