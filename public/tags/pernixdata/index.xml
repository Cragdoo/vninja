      <description>As we all know by now, PernixData was gobbled up by Nutanix a while back, and since then there has been a nothing but silence on the future of the FVP and Architect products. Now it seems it&amp;rsquo;s over. The acquisition trigged a bunch of PernixData employees moving elsewhere, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the products time to move on as well.
From what I&amp;rsquo;m hearing, End of Sale and End of Life for both products are due to be announced soon.</description>

      <description>Following the success of the first vSphere Design Pocketbook, PernixData has created a new version, this time dubbed &amp;laquo;Blog Edition&amp;raquo;. Where the first book focused on small &amp;laquo;tweet sized&amp;raquo; design tips, the new one allows for more in-depth articles, lifting the first editions 200 character limit.
For some reason, I have been lucky enough to be selected as one of the contributors!
You can pick up a printed copy at the PernixData Booth (1017) at VMworld US, or pre-order your electronic copy today.</description>
