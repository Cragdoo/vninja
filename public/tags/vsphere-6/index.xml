      <description>The new VMware Software Manager, which was released at the same time as vSphere 6, is a great way to get your download ducks in a row, and not manually download all the different vSphere pieces one by one.
But all these downloads sure eat up disk space, and if you, like me, chose the wrong download location while installing VMware Software Manager what do you do? There is no way in the web interface to change the download directory after installation, so how do you change it?</description>

      <description>New Update: Alex Jauch, VAIO Product Manager has provided an update on why there there has been so little information available, and when to expect that to change.
Updated: Since this post was initially published, information about the VAIO capabilities in vSphere 6.0 has been published. In vSphere APIs for IO Filtering Ken Werneburg goes through the details on how it works, and how partners will get access through a SDK some time in the coming months.</description>
