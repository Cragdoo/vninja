      <description>In my work as a consultant I often have many small tasks to perform for customers, all while completing a bigger project. I have found that an easy way to keep track of all the little and big changes, is to create a ChangeLog. Normally ChangeLog&amp;rsquo;s are referenced in development projects, but it also sense to use it to track of your own, or your team members, changes to an infrastructure environment.</description>

      <description>William Lam posted &amp;ldquo;Why you should rename the default VSAN Datastore name&amp;rdquo; where he outlines why the default name for VSAN data stores should be changed. Of course, I completely agree with his views on this; Leaving it at the default might cause confusion down the line.
At the end of the post, William asks the following:
I wonder if it would be a useful to have a feature in VSAN to automatically append the vSphere Cluster name to the default VSAN Datastore name?</description>
