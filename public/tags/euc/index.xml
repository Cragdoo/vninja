      <description>Mike Laverick and Barry Coombs has released their new book, elegantly titled &amp;ldquo;Building End-User Computing Solutions with VMware View&amp;rdquo;.
Not only is this a great book, it is something that every existing and potential VMware View (and related technologies in the EUC area) administrator should add to their (digital) bookshelves.
I´ll let the authors themselves describe it:
This book is all about VMware View 5.1 and ThinApp 4.7.2 administration - and it takes in a wide scope of complementary technologies from the likes of Teradici, BitDefender and F5 Networks.</description>
