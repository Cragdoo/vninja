      <description>I have given the site a small facelift, replacing the old theme with a new and cleaner version. For some reason, I get this &amp;laquo;theme itch&amp;raquo; a couple of times a year, but usually I manage to let it pass without doing many changes.
This time it stuck with me though, and ended up with replacing the old theme with a new one. In fact, the old theme had been active for close to two years now, so it was time to shake things up a bit any way.</description>
