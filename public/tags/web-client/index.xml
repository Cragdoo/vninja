      <description>I almost choked on my coffee this morning when I saw William Lam announcing a new VMware Fling calledÂ ESXi Embedded Host Client. Finally the day when we can get a local vSphere Web Client on a standalone host is here, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a moment too soon. This feature has been missing since ESX 3 and it&amp;rsquo;s VMware Infrastructure Web Access. For now, this is a Fling (which means unsupported and so on), but I really hope that this ends up being built-in to ESXi very soon &amp;ndash; even on the free vSphere Hypervisor.</description>

      <description>During some way overdue housekeeping in my HP Microserver-based &amp;ldquo;Homelab&amp;rdquo; today, I ran into a rather annoying issue that prevented me from starting one of my more important VMs; namely my home Domain Controller.
In short, I removed an old SSD drive that I&amp;rsquo;ve used for vFlash Read Cache (vFRC) testing and installed a new 1TB drive instead. Since I have a rather beefy work lab now, I need space more than speed at home, so this seemed like a good idea at the time.</description>
