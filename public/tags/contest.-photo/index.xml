      <description>I have a free Google Chromecast to give a way to one lucky winner. As part of being voted into the top 50 VMware &amp;amp; virtualization blogs I was lucky enough to win one for myself, and as an added bonus I get to give away one to one of my readers too!
To be able to find a worthy winner of it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to host a contest.</description>
