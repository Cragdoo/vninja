      <description>Another VMworld US is over, with huge attendee numbers and in keeping with tradition lots of new announcements were made. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go through them, enough posts have been made about that, the basis of this post is something completely different all together.
There seems to be a general expectation that we as a community is to be wooed by the announcements and flashy keynotes, but are we really the target audience?</description>
