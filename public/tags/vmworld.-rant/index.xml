      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another VMworld US is over, with huge attendee numbers and in keeping with tradition lots of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viktorious.nl/2014/09/01/vmworld-2014-announcements/&#34;&gt;new announcements&lt;/a&gt; were made. Â I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go through them, enough posts have been made about that, the basis of this post is something completely different all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a general expectation that we as a community is to be wooed by the announcements and flashy keynotes, but are we really the target audience? If you think about it, we probably aren&amp;rsquo;t.
