      <description>A little over a year ago I posted Combining Todoist and Evernote, because awesome and I thought it was about time to post a follow up now one year later.
Evernote: Firstly, my Evernote is still a giant mess, just as it was a year ago. I have lots of data in Evernote, but it&amp;rsquo;s main purpose is just storing quick notes on ongoing projects and it serves as a basis for generating proper documentation.</description>

      <description>A while back I declared Evernote bankruptcy, even if I managed to misspell it while doing so:
That&#39;s it, I&#39;m declaring [@evernote](https://twitter.com/evernote) bankrupcy. — Christian Mohn™ (@h0bbel) [May 22, 2014](https://twitter.com/h0bbel/status/469455493631860736)  The thing is, I really want to use Evernote in a proper and organised manner. The problem is; I was completely unable to do so, mostly since I had no clear idea on the how, the when and the why back when I started using it many moons ago.</description>
