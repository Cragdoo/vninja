      <description>Like everyone else in the vUniverse, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a play with the very recently released free vSphere Client for iPad. Since everyone, and their mother, has already blogged and reviewed it I don&amp;rsquo;t see much value in me doing the same.
What I can say though, is that the first impression is pretty great. It looks good, works well and might be one of the apps that finally gives me an actual use case for the iPad.</description>
