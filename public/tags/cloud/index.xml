      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vninja.net/img/VMware-AWS_750.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;After yesterdays announcement of VMware Cloud™ on AWS &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/VMWonAWS?src=hash&#34;&gt;everyone and their distant relatives&lt;/a&gt; have published their opinion pieces on the relevance of the deal, and what who got the short end of the stick in this deal.  I guess this is my attempt, or me too post if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a few of you have noticed, I recently changed my title on &lt;a href=&#34;https://no.linkedin.com/in/christianmohn&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Chief Consultant&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Architect&lt;/strong&gt; in the newly formed &lt;a href=&#34;http://evry.no&#34;&gt;EVRY&lt;/a&gt; Cloud Consulting division, but what does that mean and perhaps more importantly, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest description I have found to describe what my new role is this:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autolab goes Cloudy with a Chance of Free Credits </title>

      <description>Autolab, that awesome &amp;laquo;little&amp;raquo; thing that automagically builds a nested vSphere Lab environment for you, was definitely not put together by Flint Lockwood but by Alastair Cooke (www.demitasse.co.nz). Unlike Flint´s inventions, this one actually makes sense and serves a purpose!
Now, how sweet would it be to deploy Autolab without having to invest time, money and effort into acquiring your own hardware?
Well, thanks to baremetalcloud.com, you might now actually be able to do just that (and more, if you wish).</description>

      <title>VMware launches Public vCloud &#34;Test-Drive&#34;</title>

      <description>VMware Offers vCloud “Test-Drive” with New Evaluation Service.
This announcement doesn´t seem to be &amp;laquo;Project Zephyr&amp;raquo; which, if the rumors are true, is VMware´s own fully fledged IaaS service.
This Public vCloud “Test-Drive” service, which VMware themselves describe as “white-label” from a vCloud service provider, seems like a way for VMware to provide cheap test-drive access, to vCloud through their existing service providers.
Where the rumored &amp;laquo;Project Zephyr&amp;raquo; might be seen as a competing service, Public vCloud looks to be engineered to drive long term customers to the existing ecosystem of providers.</description>
