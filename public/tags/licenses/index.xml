      <description>Mike Laverick has started something of a petition to bring back the VMTN Subscription option, and I could not agree more!
The VMTN Subscription was a way for interested parties to pay for a years subscription to VMware products, akin to the Microsoft Technet subscription program. It&amp;rsquo;s not intended for production use, but as a means to get hold of products for lab work, testing and development.
I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why VMware pulled the plug on that option back in 2007, but I do understand why it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring it back to life.</description>
