      <description>Eric Siebert has just announced the preliminary details for next years Top vBlogÂ vote. This time around it is sponsored by Veeam, and there are even prizes to be won, not only the notorious fame and fortune that comes with being voted in the top percentile.
Thanks again to Eric for putting all of this together, there is a lot of work involved and the community really values the effort.</description>
