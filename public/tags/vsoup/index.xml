      <description>vSoup Episode #10 is finally released, this time with Stuart Radnidge (blog) as our guest. This episode is a bit unusual, as we didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a set agenda before starting the recording, so we jump around all of the place covering a pretty wide area of topics. Be sure to check it out!
Tech Field Day #6 is approaching really fast, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s only a week away now! I will leave for Boston on Tuesday, June 7, for what looks to be a very, very busy but fun couple of days.</description>

      <description>The fourth edition (Big Fat Pipes with Bob) of the vSoup podcast is now available. This time we had the honor of having Bob Plankers as a guest. Bob runs The Lone Sysadmin, where his recent post &amp;ldquo;Blame&amp;rdquo; really resonated well with me personally.
The fact of the matter is that in many cases Bob is right, virtualization admins ends up being blamed for everything.
No matter who’s fault it actually is, though, I’m the one-stop shop now for blame.</description>

      <description>Some times things just happen, and before you know it you&amp;rsquo;re sitting in your in-laws living room talking to an Englishman and an American via Skype. And to top it of; it&amp;rsquo;s all being recorded. And to make matters even worse, we decided to try and make it a regular thing. The recordings that is, not the &amp;ldquo;in your in-laws living room&amp;rdquo; thing, that was a one-off for sure.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say here is that yours truly, Ed Czerwin and Chris Dearden has decided that we want to be rock-stars and start our own little virtualization related podcast.</description>
