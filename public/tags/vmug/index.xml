      <description>The 2016 Nordic VMUG UserCon in Copenhagen, Denmark, is just 11 days away, and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t registered already now is the time to do so. As usual the speaker lineup for the event is awesome, with a lot of the usual suspects like Duncan Epping (VMware), Cormac Hogan (VMware), Lee Dilworth (VMware), and Frank Denneman (VMware), but VMware is also showing it&amp;rsquo;s commitment to VMUG by sending some non-europeans as well, like Grant Orchard and_ Mike Foley_.</description>

      <description>Last year, in November, the first ever meeting in VMUG Norway took place in my hometown of Bergen, and since then there has been meetings in Oslo, Trondheim and a second one in Bergen as well.
Getting the Norwegian VMUG up and running was a long process. I decided to have a go at it, and I spent a lot of time talking to people, thinking, planning and generally wondering how we could get it started and how to proceed.</description>

      <description>Last year I was lucky enough to get to travel to Copenhagen and visit the Nordic VMUG conference. Sadly it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make it this year, but don&amp;rsquo;t let that stop you! While we in Norway are still trying to get our local VMUG up and running, more news on that in a very short while, the danish VMUG is really the driving force and the leading star for the rest of us in the nordics.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday, December 3, 2013 VMware User Group Denmark arranged theNordic VMUG Conference. The event itself can only be described as a mini-VMworld, with over 600 registered attendees, and a speaker list worthy of such a nick-name.
The opening keynote was held by Joe Baguley, the closing keynote was held by Chad Sakac. In between those two, you had the possibility to attend sessions held by Cormac Hogan, Mike Laverick, Frank Brix, Paudie O-Riordan, Frank Denneman, Mattias Sundling, David Davis and Duncan Epping.</description>
