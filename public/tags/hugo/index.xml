      <description>Migrating From Wordpress to Hugo aka The Long and Winding Road  When I decided to move away from Wordpress and over to Hugo, I really had no concept of the amount of work it would be. Simply put; I just decided to do it â€” without really knowing what I set out to do.

What really triggered it, was my hosting providers unwillingness to upgrade basic things, like PHP versions and MySQL. That combined with the security issues you have to live with when using traditional shared hosting made me look around for alternatives. While looking at hosting options, it slowly dawned on me that perhaps I should be looking at doing something completely different.</description>
