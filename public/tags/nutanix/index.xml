      <description>As we all know by now, PernixData was gobbled up by Nutanix a while back, and since then there has been a nothing but silence on the future of the FVP and Architect products. Now it seems it&amp;rsquo;s over. The acquisition trigged a bunch of PernixData employees moving elsewhere, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the products time to move on as well.
From what I&amp;rsquo;m hearing, End of SaleÂ and End of Life for both products are due to be announced soon.</description>
