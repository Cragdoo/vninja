      <description>For the first time since 2010 I will actually be physically attending VMworld Europe! I fly over from the very cold, rainy and generally very autumny Norway to sunny Barcelona on Sunday the 13th.
Based on my past experience from VMworld in Copenhagen, I have decided to go easy on the session scheduling and not fill my calendar to the brim.
Sure, the sessions provide insane amounts of useful content, but for me the main reason to attend VMworld is to physically meet up and talk to a lot of the people I usually spend a lot of time communicating with.</description>
