      <description>Trainsignal has just launched a new Online Training bundle, and for $49 a month you can get unlimited access to their entire set of training courses and practice exams for Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Citrix, CompTIA, and VMware.

The new pricing is very attractive, especially since you no longer need to buy access on a course by course basis.
The courses are delivered in your browser, but Trainsignal also offers an offline player in case you need access when traveling or otherwise offline.</description>
