      <description>Back in February 2011 I was invited, along with my IT Manager, to do a presentation at Digital Ship Scandinavia 2011.
Digital Ship magazine has now published an article based on what we presented at the live event. As far as I can gather, based on the feedback both at the event and afterwards, the presentation was a success and now the Digital Ship Magazine for April 2011 includes a two page article based on the entire presentation.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Maish Saidel-Keesing, vExpert 2010 and blogger over at Technodrone I have been made aware that VMware has used one of my posts here on vNinja in their internal presentation material.
The material in question is vSphere 4.1 to 4.0 differences (page 44 and 45 in vSphere 4.1 Deep Dive - Part 1 - v6.pptx), where my post about Using USB Pass-through in vSphere 4.1 is quoted and my screenshots used.</description>
