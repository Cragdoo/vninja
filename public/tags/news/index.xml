      <description>VMware has just announced vSAN v6.6, with over 20 new features. While new and shiny features are nice I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight a couple that I think might be undervalued from release feature-set perspective, but highly valuable in day to day operations of a vSAN environment, otherwise known as Day 2 operations.

      <description>Now that the seasons have changed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at 2017 and start planning the year. First up, when is VMworld 2017, and perhaps most importantly where? There has been a lot of speculation about this, and the perhaps strongest rumour was that it was moving to Berlin.
The details for the US has already been posted on vmworld.com, but for Europe all it says is &amp;ldquo;Fall&amp;rdquo;.
According to Duncan, which usually is in the know, VMworld Europe 2017 will once again be in Barcelona, but in September instead of October.</description>

While the quote itself is correct, I feel that there is a need to further expand on what I said, in the context it was given in.
So here it is, my entire response:
My reaction to Steve Herrods departure is probably on par with just about everyone else&#39;s, one of surprise.</description>

      <description>VMware Offers vCloud “Test-Drive” with New Evaluation Service.
This announcement doesn´t seem to be &amp;ldquo;Project Zephyr&amp;rdquo; which, if the rumors are true, is VMware´s own fully fledged IaaS service.
This Public vCloud “Test-Drive” service, which VMware themselves describe as “white-label” from a vCloud service provider, seems like a way for VMware to provide cheap test-drive access, to vCloud through their existing service providers.
Where the rumored &amp;ldquo;Project Zephyr&amp;rdquo; might be seen as a competing service, Public vCloud looks to be engineered to drive long term customers to the existing ecosystem of providers.</description>
