      <description>Have you ever wondered what happens if you give 10.000 people access to an open-beta that is supposed to be under NDA?
Firstly, the NDA is no-go from the get-go. There is no way you can claim that you actually expect 10.000 people to not talk about something they know about. VMware vSpere 6.0 was the worst kept secret ever, for a reason. It might have been planned that way all along for all I know, but if that was the case, the NDA should never have been in place to begin with.</description>
