      <description>Last year I was lucky enough to get to travel to Copenhagen and visit the Nordic VMUG conference. Sadly it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make it this year, but don&amp;rsquo;t let that stop you! While we in Norway are still trying to get our local VMUG up and running, more news on that in a very short while, the danish VMUG is really the driving force and the leading star for the rest of us in the nordics.</description>
