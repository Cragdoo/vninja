      <description>While I was away on a two week holiday on the Croatia&amp;rsquo;s sunny Makarska Rivijera, Eric Siebert announced the result of his annual Top vBlog, and much to my surprise vNinja did quite the jump from last years 46th spot to this years 27th! Honestly, I thought the site would drop out of the the top 50 list this year, but once again I&amp;rsquo;m proven to be mistaken. Some times being wrong is just great!</description>

      <description>A little over a month ago I announced the Want to Win a Google Chromecast contest and finally the winner has been selected. Since there was a grand total of 5 submissions, and one of them was immediately disqualified for a distinct lack of Ninja-presence, I decided to just do a random draw.
The submitted photos were numbered by the order they appeared in on my post as I took this screenshot.</description>

      <description>Christopher Kusek, who runs pkguild.com, has just announced that he is running a contest where you can win a VMware Workstation 9 license.
Seeing that announcement, and the fact that Christopher was nice enough to mention both me and vNinja.net in it, I have decided to also give away a license that has been lingering unused in my possession way to long.
Instead of running my own contest, my license has been added to the existing contest so head on over there to read all the details.</description>

      <description>[VMworld Europe 2010 is close. Very close. In fact, lots of people are already in place in Copenhagen, personally I don’t get until tomorrow evening (the 11th).
Since I get in pretty late, I really hope I’ll be able to get to my hotel quickly, and then find Custom House for the Tweetup/VMUG Party.
Remember I have a little contest going, where you can win a copy of Trainsignal VMware vSphere Pro Series Training Vol.</description>
