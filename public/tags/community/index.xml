      <description>The recent months, and weeks, has made me question the value of the &amp;ldquo;vCommunity&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m even questioning if there really is such a thing at all any more. I believe there was such a thing at one point, but it seems to be fading fast into history, only to be replaced by hyperbole of egonormous proportions. Back in the old days, and this might just be me showing my greying of beards moment, the hyperbole wasn&amp;rsquo;t a strong a force as it seems to be today.</description>

      <description>Last year, in November, the first ever meeting in VMUG Norway took place in my hometown of Bergen, and since then there has been meetings in Oslo, Trondheim and a second one in Bergen as well.
Getting the Norwegian VMUG up and running was a long process. I decided to have a go at it, and I spent a lot of time talking to people, thinking, planning and generally wondering how we could get it started and how to proceed.</description>

      <description>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s time to vote for the top VMware &amp;amp; virtualization blogs. As usual Eric Siebert has opened up the floodgates and set up a voting system, and once again managed to create a lot of work for himself.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s all make it worth his while and get as many votes in as possible! There are a lot of blogs listed, this time there are over 300 in total.</description>

      <description>Some times all it takes is one single tweet to set things in motion:
Just a year after losing Dad to cancer, Mom&#39;s has now spread from lung to other areas. Too soon for this shit. — Gabriel Chapman (@Bacon_Is_King) [September 12, 2013](https://twitter.com/Bacon_Is_King/statuses/378283415839051776) This started a spiral of tweets, discussions and ideas being thrown around and has now resulted in Podcasting for Cancer.
The current goal is to raise $5000 USD by November 12th - Let´s absolutely crush that goal!</description>

      <description>So, what is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
As we all (should) know, that is very much a trick question.
Now, consider this little non-trick question:
I wonder what the avg disk size is for your virtual machine these days. I do most math with 60GB on avg, but wonder if that has changed   [@DuncanYB](https://twitter.com/DuncanYB/status/317269670195507203) / March 28th 2013    And now, guess what?</description>

      <description>I love it when a plan comes together, especially when someone gets an idea and then someone fires on all cylinders and executes!
As mentioned before, there has been a lot of talk about various ways to create a &amp;ldquo;soapbox&amp;rdquo; for all those who submitted VMworld sessions and got rejected, or those who did not submit but would still like to present.
Thankfully the guys behind vBrownBags has teamed up with VMware communities and are now offering this opportunity at VMworld 2012.</description>

      <description>**VMworld Session Reject Club 1st RULE: You do talk about Reject Club. **
Today VMware has sent out notifications to VMworld 2012 session submitters, with a yay or nay email. Of course, this sparked a lot of conversation on Twitter, and Scott Lowe published a blog post proposing a VMworld Unconference, and exploring several options:
 A physical “unconference”
 A virtual “unconference”
 A series of 10-minute “flash talks” at VMworld 2012</description>
