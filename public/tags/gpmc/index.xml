      <description>A fellow IT-professional, who works with the non-wired flavor of networking, contacted me with the following scenario:
A group of users, developers in this case, have VMware Workstation installed on their laptops. This makes it easy for them to manage, test and develop their applications in a closed environment without having to install a bunch of tools/services on their centrally managed laptop environment. An excellent use case for VMware Workstation if there ever was one.</description>
