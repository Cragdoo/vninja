      <title>VSAN - The Unspoken Future</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This rather &lt;em&gt;tongue-in-cheek&lt;/em&gt; title, is a play on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maishsk/&#34;&gt;Maish &lt;/a&gt;recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://technodrone.blogspot.com/2014/03/vsan-unspoken-truth.html&#34;&gt;VSAN - The Unspoken Truth&lt;/a&gt; post where he highlights what he thinks is one of the hidden &amp;laquo;problems&amp;raquo; with the current version of VSAN is it&amp;rsquo;s inherent non-blade compatibility and current lack of &amp;laquo;rack based VSAN ready nodes&amp;raquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a reality; If you base your current infrastructure on blade servers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/virtual-san&#34;&gt;VSAN&lt;/a&gt; probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a good match as it stands today. Chances are that if you are currently running a blade-based datacenter, you have traditional external storage on the back end of that, and that you for quite some time will be running a form factor that VSAN simply isn&amp;rsquo;t designed for. I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with Maish in that conclusion, not a bit.

      <title>Random VCDX Tips and Quotes?</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/virtualization/random-vcdx-tips-quotes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vNinja-Labs.png&#34; alt=&#34;vNinja-Labs&#34; /&gt;I needed something to spruce up my desktop environment, and it seems that one of the more popular ways to do that is to display random quotes and such on your desktop. Instead of hooking up to an existing quotes database, I simply made my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have collected a few VCDX related tips and quotes, primarily from the archive &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/DuncanYB&#34;&gt;Duncan Epping&lt;/a&gt; put together of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/10/01/vcdx-tips-from-vcdx-001-john-arrasjid/&#34;&gt;VCDX Tips from VCDX 001 John Arrasjid&lt;/a&gt;, but also from the &amp;laquo;submissions&amp;raquo; I got from &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/vcdx-give-quote/&#34;&gt;VCDX? Give Me a Quote!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If anyone else wants their quote/tip/hint added to the database, please let me know!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing &#34;Could not create vFlash cache&#34; error when powering on a VM</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/virtualization/fixing-could-create-vflash-cache-error-powering-vm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During some way overdue housekeeping in my HP Microserver-based &amp;laquo;Homelab&amp;raquo; today, I ran into a rather annoying issue that prevented me from starting one of my more important VMs; namely my home Domain Controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I removed an old SSD drive that I&amp;rsquo;ve used for vFlash Read Cache (vFRC) testing and installed a new 1TB drive instead. Since I have a rather beefy work lab now, I need space more than speed at home, so this seemed like a good idea at the time.

      <title>Social Media, Karma and Being a Dick</title>

      <description>Rant alert [@Acronis](https://twitter.com/Acronis) sorry, not happening. — Christian Mohn (@h0bbel) [October 8, 2013](https://twitter.com/h0bbel/statuses/387562111972683776) In and of itself, this tweet is fair enough, even if borderline spam. My reaction to it however, tells a different story. _I admit it, it´s a bit harsh and straight to the point, but something has to have triggered such a response, right? _Rewind back to VMworld US, and Acronis posted this:

      <title>Can you combine vSphere Host Cache and vFlash on a single SSD?</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/combine-vsphere-host-cache-vflash-single-ssd/</link>

      <description>One of the new features in vSphere 5.5 is the vSphere vFlash that enables you to use a SSD/Flash device as a read cache for your storage. Duncan Epping has a series of posts on vSphere Flash Cache that is well worth a read.
vSphere vFlash caches your read IOs, but at the same time you can use it as a swap device if you run into memory contention issues. The vSphere vFlash Host Cache is similar to the older Host Cache feature, but if you are upgrading from an older version of ESXi there is a couple of things that needs to be done to be able to use this feature.</description>

      <title>vCenter Client Download URLs</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/vcenter-client-download-urls/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/vcenter-client-download-urls/</guid>
      <description>Since the vCenter Client no longer is bundled with an ESXi host installation, I´ve compiled a quick list of direct download URLs for the most recent clients.
Update 17th September 2014: VMware has published the official list in knowledge base article KB2089791, use that as the official list going forward.
Remember, the client download URL is still available from the vCenter server, if you point your browser to it.</description>
