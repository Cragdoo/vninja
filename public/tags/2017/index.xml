      <description>Keeping up with tradition (you thought I was going to say Kardashians there, didn&amp;rsquo;t you?), it&amp;rsquo;s time to evaluate 2017.
My list of goals for 2017 and the verdict is as follows:
 **Get that VCAP6-DCV Design exam out of the way **Done and dusted (for 6.5 that is, not 6.0). I&amp;rsquo;ve also updated my VCP to 6.5, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently waiting for the VCAP6.5-DCV Deploy exam. *Score: 10/10*
 **AWS Associate Certifications **Didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.</description>

      <description>Considering it&amp;rsquo;s mid-january 2017 already, it&amp;rsquo;s time to do my annual goal list for the new year.
My goals for 2017:  Get that VCAP6-DCV Design exam out of the way — I did the beta in march 2016, but missed the mark by a small margin.
 AWS Associate Certifications — Not sure how many of the three exams I want to do yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to at least give the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam a go.</description>

      <description>Now that the seasons have changed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at 2017 and start planning the year. First up, when is VMworld 2017, and perhaps most importantly where? There has been a lot of speculation about this, and the perhaps strongest rumour was that it was moving to Berlin.
The details for the US has already been posted on vmworld.com, but for Europe all it says is &amp;laquo;Fall&amp;raquo;.
According to Duncan, which usually is in the know, VMworld Europe 2017 will once again be in Barcelona, but in September instead of October.</description>
