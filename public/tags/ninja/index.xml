      <description>A little over a month ago I announced the Want to Win a Google Chromecast contest and finally the winner has been selected. Since there was a grand total of 5 submissions, and one of them was immediately disqualified for a distinct lack of Ninja-presence, I decided to just do a random draw.
The submitted photos were numbered by the order they appeared in on my post as I took this screenshot.</description>

      <description>I have a free Google Chromecast to give a way to one lucky winner. As part of being voted into the top 50 VMware &amp;amp; virtualization blogs I was lucky enough to win one for myself, and as an added bonus I get to give away one to one of my readers too!
To be able to find a worthy winner of it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to host a contest.</description>
