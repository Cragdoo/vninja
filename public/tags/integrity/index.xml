      <description>Now that vSphere 5.1 and assorted products have been released into the wild, how do you check the integrity of your downloaded file? As you might be aware of, VMware publishes both MD5 and SHA1 hashes for their files, making it possible to check if the file you just downloaded is identical to the file offered from VMware.
Checking the MD5 or SHA1 hash for a single file is easy, at least in OS X where you donÂ´t need any third party tools to check.</description>
