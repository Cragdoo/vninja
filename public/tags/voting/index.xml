      <description>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s time to vote for the top VMware &amp;amp; virtualization blogs. As usual Eric Siebert has opened up the floodgates and set up a voting system, and once again managed to create a lot of work for himself.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s all make it worth his while and get as many votes in as possible! There are a lot of blogs listed, this time there are over 300 in total.</description>
