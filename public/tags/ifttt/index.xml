      <description>Myles Gray asked me how I integrate Pocket with Todoist, after my How I use Todoist post, and the answer is very simple: IFTTT. If-This-Then-That lets you connect services, and create rules (or applets) that trigger based on events in those services, luckily both Todoist and Pocket are supported.
Now, there is a bit of overlap between how I use Pocket and Todoist, but I mainly use Pocket to keep track of links I want to either read later, or use as basis for blog posts.</description>

      <description>A while back I declared Evernote bankruptcy, even if I managed to misspell it while doing so:
That&#39;s it, I&#39;m declaring [@evernote](https://twitter.com/evernote) bankrupcy. — Christian Mohn™ (@h0bbel) [May 22, 2014](https://twitter.com/h0bbel/status/469455493631860736)  The thing is, I really want to use Evernote in a proper and organised manner. The problem is; I was completely unable to do so, mostly since I had no clear idea on the how, the when and the why back when I started using it many moons ago.</description>
