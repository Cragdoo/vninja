      <description>The last day of Tech Field Day #6 myself and all the other delegates were lucky enough to get a sneak peek at stealth startup &amp;lsquo;Zerto&amp;rsquo;. We weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to talk about it until the 22nd and I know I am a little slow on the punch but I currently haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a lot of coverage. Just for an initial disclosure statement my trip to Tech Field Day 6 was paid for by the vendors we visited, however, I am in no way obligated to write about them or publicize them in any manner.</description>
