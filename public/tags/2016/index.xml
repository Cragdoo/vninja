      <description>Back in February 2016 I published my goals for 2016, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to review that list:
 Shake things up a bit – **Go big or go home. **This one is easy, in April 2016 I moved from EVRY to Proact, with a clear mission statement: Build and develop Norways best SDDC team. As is always the case when changing positions and companies, a lot of time is spent on getting to know the new organisation but we&amp;rsquo;re getting there.</description>
