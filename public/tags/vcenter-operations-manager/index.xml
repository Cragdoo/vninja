      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer of mine, who runs a pure HP environment based on c7000 and StoreServ 7200, wanted to get the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A93zVmnheEE&#34;&gt;HP Insight Control Storage Module for vCenter&lt;/a&gt; up and running. The problem was that while we were able to connect to the older MSA array they run for non-production workloads, we were unable to connect to the newer StoreServ 7200. There is full IP connectivity between the application server that the HP Insight components run on and the storage controllers/VSP (no firewalls between them, they are located in the same subnet).

      <title>Purging the vCenter Operations Manager 5.x Database</title>

      <description>A client of mine recently had their vCenter 5.0 appliance replaced with a new vCenter 5.1 appliance, something vCenter Operations Manager did not enjoy. In this case the original vCenter 5.0 Appliance was turned shut down, a new 5.1 Appliance deployed, with the same IP as the old one, and then configured. Naturally the existing hosts were added to the fresh vCenter, clusters recreated and in general everything was reconfigured.</description>

      <title>vCenter Operations Manager and vCenter Deployment Dependency</title>

      <description>In order to be able to deploy vCenter Operations Manager, the ESXi host it is deployed to needs to be managed by a vCenter. At first glance, that seems like a fair and pretty straight forward requirement, right? But, is it?
While I can see the need for a vCenter in the environment that vCenter Operations Manager is supposed to monitor, I don´t understand why the host you want to deploy the vApp on has to be managed by a vCenter instance as well?</description>
