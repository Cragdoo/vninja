      <title>Using CloudFlare for Dynamic DNS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/dynamic-dns-requirements/&#34;&gt;In my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I tried to lay out the foundation and reasoning behind requiring a Dynamic DNS Service, and here is how I solved it using CloudFlare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I moved my chosen domain name to CloudFlare, and made sure everything resolved ok with static records. Once that was working, I started playing around with the CloudFlare API, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/&#34;&gt;Cocoa Rest Client&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no developer (as is probably very apparent by the script below), nor API wizard of any kind, but it was fairly easy figuring out how to craft a request that lists my DNS zone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic DNS Requirements</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on my new &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/taking-it-to-far/&#34;&gt;Homelab&lt;/a&gt; setup, I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating ways to provide hostname based access to several web services located in my DMZ zone. Since my provider doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide static IP addresses, I also need an external Dynamic DNS service, to provide said hostname mappings through the reverse proxy on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are loads of Dynamic DNS services available, most of them lets you use some sort of predefined domain name scheme, and point it to your external IP, but I wanted to use a domain name that I own and control. Since I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudflare.com&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; to provide DNS services (amongst other things) for this very site, it was a natural choice to see if they could fit the bill for my lab needs as well. Turns out, not only can they provide the services I need for free, they also allow me to play around and have fun at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;
