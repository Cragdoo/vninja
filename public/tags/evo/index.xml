      <description>VMware has finally announced what I&amp;rsquo;ve been speculating about for some time now, EVO:RAIL was announced at VMworld US this morning. Short story; It&amp;rsquo;s aÂ HCIA (Hyper Converged Infrastructure Appliance), offered through several hardware vendors, with a new integrated management solution.

      <description>Finally. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a way to put two of my favourite things together in a completely non-sensical way, namely VMware Marvin and Pearl Jam. As The Register reported earlier today, odds are that Marvin no longer responds to it&amp;rsquo;s project name, but rather to the new EVO name recently trademarked by VMware. There has been whispers of a Marvin name change for quite some time, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t really hard to believe.</description>
