      <description>Book Recommendations August 2018 Every now and then new vSphere related &amp;laquo;must-have&amp;raquo; books are released, and this month there is no less than two of them, namely the vSphere 6.7 Clustering Deep Dive and VDI Design Guide: A comprehensive guide to help you design VMware Horizon, based on modern standards.
vSphere 6.7 Clustering Deep Dive This updated version (the 5th version) covers vSphere 6.7, and it&amp;rsquo;s a real brick.</description>

      <description>Migrating From Wordpress to Hugo aka The Long and Winding Road  When I decided to move away from Wordpress and over to Hugo, I really had no concept of the amount of work it would be. Simply put; I just decided to do it — without really knowing what I set out to do.
Once I had decided on a foundation theme, I chose the Hugo Bootstrap Premium as my starting point, the real work started.</description>

      <description>Goodbye Wordpress, hello Hugo! vNinja.net has been powered by Wordpress since it was launched back in 2010, and frankly it was time for a change. What really triggered it, was my hosting providers unwillingness to upgrade basic things, like PHP versions and MySQL. That combined with the security issues you have to live with when using traditional shared hosting made me look around for alternatives. While looking at hosting options, it slowly dawned on me that perhaps I should be looking at doing something completely different.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like Sam and Simon over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/05/gdpr-blogging-and-definit/&#34;&gt;definit.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve done a quick GDPR-related overhaul of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the two English scholars and gentlemen, I&amp;rsquo;ve created the required &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/privacy-policy/&#34;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; page. I&amp;rsquo;ve also deleted all existing comments on the site, and disabled comments sitewide — hopefully that&amp;rsquo;s enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, joy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third talk I&amp;rsquo;ve found worthy of publishing in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/awesome-talks/&#34;&gt;Awesome Talks&lt;/a&gt; series. Enjoy &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/swardley&#34;&gt;Simon Wardley&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Researcher, Leading Edge Forum, keynote from &lt;a href=&#34;https://kccnceu18.sched.com/event/EDv7/keynote-crossing-the-river-by-feeling-the-stones-simon-wardley-researcher-leading-edge-forum?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=100%&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no&#34;&gt;KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2018&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;laquo;Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones&amp;raquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s presentation technique, flair and master of language is flat out impressive — and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alerting on &#34;Bootbank cannot be found at path ‘/bootbank’&#34; in vRealize Operations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you boot your ESXi hosts from SD-cards or USB you might have run into this issue. Suddenly your host(s) displays the following under events:
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;laquo;Bootbank cannot be found at path ‘/bootbank’.&amp;raquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually this means that the boot device has been corrupted somehow, either due to a device failure or &lt;a href=&#34;https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2144283&#34;&gt;other issues&lt;/a&gt;. Normally the host continues to run, until it&amp;rsquo;s rebooted that is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Curious Case of the Intel Microcode Part #2 - It Gets Better — Then Worse</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/news/curious-case-intel-microcode-part-2-gets-better-worse/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/news/curious-case-intel-microcode-part-2-gets-better-worse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This guest post by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bajorgensen&#34;&gt;Bjørn Anders Jørgensen&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Systems Consultant Basefarm, first appeared on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-case-intel-microcode-part-2-gets-better-worse-jørgensen/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start on this rather long post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/the-curious-case-of-the-intel-microcode/&#34;&gt;have a go at part #1&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt; tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long read. To get to the juicy part on how Intel potentially shipped pre-release microcode to partners, skip to section 3. The short, short version is that the official Intel microcode update contains newer microcode for Skylake-SP and Kaby Lake/Coffe Lake than what currently is shipping from VMware/HPE/DellEMC etc.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This guest post by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bajorgensen&#34;&gt;Bjørn Anders Jørgensen&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Systems Consultant Basefarm, first appeared on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-case-intel-microcode-bjørn-anders-jørgensen/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: This is a report based on current development as of 7. January, the situation is changing by the hour so read this opinion piece with that in hindsight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you have been living under a rock for the last week you will know by now that there is a universal design flaw in most modern microprocessors, leaving them vulnerable to a serious information disclosure problem that requires updates to all operating systems and processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the issue, start here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://spectreattack.com&#34;&gt;Meltdown and Spectre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+jwildeboer&#34;&gt;Jan Wildeboer&lt;/a&gt; also has a comprehensive timeline: &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+jwildeboer/posts/jj6a9JUaovP&#34;&gt;How we got to #Spectre and #Meltdown A Timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue has been known by Intel at least since June, and has been under embargo while everyone has been hammering out code to mitigate the threat and be ready when the embargo was lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keeping up with tradition (you thought I was going to say Kardashians there, didn&amp;rsquo;t you?), it&amp;rsquo;s time to evaluate 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list of &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/misc/2017-you-better-deliver/&#34;&gt;goals for 2017&lt;/a&gt; and the verdict is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second recorded talk published in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/awesome-talks/&#34;&gt;Awesome Talks&lt;/a&gt; series. This time it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hanselman.com/&#34;&gt;Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &amp;raquo;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not what you read, it&amp;rsquo;s what you ignore&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;raquo; talk from Dev Day in Kraków way back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a technical talk, it&amp;rsquo;s originally geared towards developers but Scott&amp;rsquo;s message should resonate with everyone in the tech field. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s about how you can deal with large amounts of information. Lot&amp;rsquo;s of great takeaways here!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>macOS: Vanilla</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Small, unobtrusive and easy to use. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good description for a macOS utility I recently discovered: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vanilla.wolves.fm/r/SyU119Hlz&#34;&gt;Vanilla&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/&#34;&gt;non-affiliate link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, this little gem let&amp;rsquo;s you hide any or all menu bar icons in macOS, while still keeping them easily accessible behind a small arrow:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post, in what hopefully will turn into a series of posts, highlighting awesome talks that are freely available. There is a lot of great content out there, both inspirational and funny, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to publish my favorites when I find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here is the first one!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Shameless self promotion ahead!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 30th I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mplesnerj&#34;&gt;Martin Plesner-Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; from Veeam for a Live Webinar: _Veeam integration with VMware vSAN, vSphere tags and SPBM policies. _&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of goodies in one place!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mass Converting .svg to .png on macOS</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/osx/mass-converting-svg-to-png-on-macos/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/osx/mass-converting-svg-to-png-on-macos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/osx/making-royal-tsx-even-more-awesome/&#34;&gt;Royal TSX&lt;/a&gt; I needed to mass convert the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vmware/clarity/tree/master/src/clarity-icons&#34;&gt;VMware Clarity&lt;/a&gt; .svg files to .png files that I could use as icons in Royal TSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying a series of different approaches, I ended up with using &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/LibRsvg?action=show&amp;amp;redirect=LibRsvg&#34;&gt;rsvg-convert from libRSVG&lt;/a&gt;. In order to get &lt;em&gt;rsvg-convert&lt;/em&gt; installed on my MacBook, I turned to &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;HomeBrew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating Pocket with Todoist via IFTTT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mylesagray/status/922783625241866241&#34;&gt;Myles Gray&lt;/a&gt; asked me how I integrate Pocket with Todoist, after my &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/workflow/how-i-use-todoist/&#34;&gt;How I use Todoist&lt;/a&gt; post, and the answer is very simple: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ifttt.com/&#34;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;. If-This-Then-That lets you connect services, and create rules (or applets) that trigger based on events in those services, luckily both Todoist and Pocket are supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there is a bit of overlap between how I use Pocket and Todoist, but I mainly use Pocket to keep track of links I want to either read later, or use as basis for blog posts.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/workflow/todoist-one-year-later/&#34;&gt;I use Todoist&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of my personal to-do list. This is the first to-do manager I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to stick with, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it daily for well over 2 years now. In that two year period I&amp;rsquo;ve reorganised it a bit, but for the most part I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep to the main structure I initially created when setting it up the first time.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/mac/features&#34;&gt;Royal TSX&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome Remote Management solution, which supports RDP, VNC, SSH, S/FTP and even ESXi and vCenter. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for years, not just because they offer &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/nfr/&#34;&gt;free licenses for vExperts&lt;/a&gt; (and others), but simply because it works really well. Store it&amp;rsquo;s config file on a synchronized file area (like Dropbox), and boom, your config follows you around from machine to machine, including custom icons. What&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to like?

      <title>PSA: Protect Your Email with DMARC</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/misc/psa-protect-your-email-with-dmarc/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2017 22:00:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://vninja.net/misc/psa-protect-your-email-with-dmarc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an uptick in spoofed emails being sent with my own personal email domain. Not only is this extremely annoying, but more problematic is that recipients receive spam and phishing emails from what seems to be my personal mail account, simply by spoofing the from address. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why domain and email address has been &amp;laquo;chosen&amp;raquo; for this, but I guess this is fallout from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.troyhunt.com/observations-and-thoughts-on-the-linkedin-data-breach/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn breach&lt;/a&gt; way back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was much I could do about this, but a recent tweet by my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thorsheim&#34;&gt;Per Thorsheim&lt;/a&gt; sent me down the rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VMware vSAN 6.6 - What&#39;s New for Day 2 Operations?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VMware has just &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/virtualblocks/2017/04/11/whats-new-vmware-vsan-6-6/&#34;&gt;announced vSAN v6.6&lt;/a&gt;, with over 20 new features. While new and shiny features are nice I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight &lt;strong&gt;a couple&lt;/strong&gt; that I think might be undervalued from release feature-set perspective, but highly valuable in day to day operations of a vSAN environment, otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;Day 2 operations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://labs.vmware.com/flings/xvc-mobility-cli#requirements&#34;&gt;VMware Cross vCenter VM Mobility - CLI&lt;/a&gt; was recently updated so I decided to try it out. In short, this little Java based application allows you to easily move or clone VMs between disparate vCenter environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the tenth edition of In The Bag!
This one comes a little late, it&amp;rsquo;s (barely) Sunday here, not Friday! Sorry about that, but I was &amp;laquo;stuck&amp;raquo; in a secure facility all week, doing a vSphere 5.5 til vSphere 6.5 migration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While at a customer site, migrating an old vSphere 5.5 environment to 6.5, several hosts suddenly crashed with a PSOD during the migration. Long story short, we got hit by this: &lt;a href=&#34;https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2147958&#34;&gt;VMware KB 2147958: _ESXi 6.5 host fails with PSOD: GP Exception 13 in multiple VMM world at VmAnon&lt;em&gt;AllocVmmPages (2147958&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post about something I experienced at a client, with &lt;em&gt;ESXi 6.0 hosts&lt;/em&gt;, today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble performing VMware snapshots, and see a  &lt;em&gt;msg.snapshot.error-QUIESCINGERROR&lt;/em&gt; error, &lt;strong&gt;check the host time settings and NTP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with the keyboard to move resize, focus and arrange your applications is a great productivity tip. When I changed from Windows to macOS a few years ago, I had a pretty &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/osx/slate-setup/&#34;&gt;convoluted setup based on Slate&lt;/a&gt; for managing keyboard shortcuts, especially for moving applications around, but this has since been simplified by using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spectacleapp.com&#34;&gt;Spectacle&lt;/a&gt; instead of Slate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have given the site a small facelift, replacing the old theme with a new and cleaner version. For some reason, I get this &amp;laquo;theme itch&amp;raquo; a couple of times a year, but usually I manage to let it pass without doing many changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time it stuck with me though, and ended up with replacing the old theme with a new one. In fact, the old theme had been active for close to two years now, so it was time to shake things up a bit any way. The new theme gives the site a fresh and in my opinion better look. The double menus in the header makes it look more organised, and less cluttered and the static navigation header is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to have for a long time now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent conversations with existing and potential clients made me realize that many are not aware that they most likely are entitled to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-log-insight.html&#34;&gt;VMware vRealize Log Insight&lt;/a&gt; in their environment. &lt;em&gt;For free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in March 2016 VMware announced that everyone with a valid VMware vCenter license are also entitled to  25-OSI pack of vRealize Log Insight for vCenter Server. This means that you can gather logs for up to 25 ESXi hosts, VMs or other devices, in your environment.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both in 2014 and in 2015 I wrote pieces on the current status of VMware vSAN, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to revisit it for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/vsan-unspoken-future/&#34;&gt;VSAN: The Unspoken Future&lt;/a&gt;
2015: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/vmware-vsan-more-than-meets-the-eye/&#34;&gt;VMware VSAN: More than meets the eye.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vSAN 6.5 was released with vSphere 6.5, and brings a few new features to the table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back &lt;a href=&#34;http://cohesity.com&#34;&gt;Cohesity&lt;/a&gt; gave me access to a lab environment, where I could play around with their HyperConverged Secondary Data solution. For those unaware of their offering entails, it&amp;rsquo;s simply put a solution for managing secondary storage. In this case, secondary storage is really everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t mission critical. It can be your backups, test/dev workloads, file shares and so on . The idea to place these unstructured data sets on a secondary storage platform, to ease management and analytics but at the same time keep it integrated with the rest of the existing environment. It&amp;rsquo;s a Distributed scale-out platform, with a pay-as-you-grow model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Cohesity supports both SMB and NFS as data entry points, and it also supports acting as a front-end for Google Cloud Storage Nearline, Microsoft Azure, Amazon S3 and Glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual the speaker lineup for the event is awesome, with a lot of the usual suspects like &lt;em&gt;Duncan Epping (VMware)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cormac Hogan (VMware)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lee Dilworth (VMware)&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Frank Denneman (VMware)&lt;/em&gt;, but VMware is also showing it&amp;rsquo;s commitment to VMUG by sending some non-europeans as well, like &lt;em&gt;Grant Orchard&lt;/em&gt; and_ Mike Foley_. This, coupled with &amp;laquo;local&amp;raquo; speakers like &lt;em&gt;Michael Ryom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nicolai Sandager&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Marteinn Sigurdsson&lt;/em&gt; this promises to be every bit as awesome as the event was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that the seasons have changed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at 2017 and start planning the year.
First up, when is VMworld 2017, and  perhaps most importantly where? There has been a lot of speculation about this, and the perhaps strongest rumour was that it was moving to Berlin.

Doing scheduled backups of non-changing data is really boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in order to get some changes done on the file system on a few Linux VMs running in the environment, I came up with the following solution:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a big proponent of the VMware vCenter Appliance for a long time, I even did a talk called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=10931&#34;&gt;VCS to VCSA Converter or How a Fling Can Be Good for You!&lt;/a&gt; on migrating to the VCSA at the Nordic VMUG last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VCSA has gone through a few iterations and versions by now, coinciding with the vSphere releases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://vninja.net/misc/using-gitbook-for-secrets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I decided to try and gather a bunch of non-public information in an easy to write and consume fashion. After a bit of fiddling, and testing different potential solutions, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gitbook.com/&#34;&gt;GitBook&lt;/a&gt; emerged as the best option. By using &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;MarkDown&lt;/a&gt; as the markup language, it’s both cross-platform and easy to manage, as the content is nothing but raw text files.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s Really in the Bag?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I &amp;laquo;launched&amp;raquo; my &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/in-the-bag/&#34;&gt;In the Bag&lt;/a&gt; series of weekly links yesterday, I figured I should really show what is indeed in the bag. Lifehacker runs a series called &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/tag/featured-bag&#34;&gt;Featured Bag&lt;/a&gt; and the voyeur in me finds it interesting what other people carry around, and how they organize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my attempt at doing the same. This is my everyday carry, most of these items are always in the bag when I leave the house in the morning. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using backpacks for years, but noticed I always just carry it around on righ shoulder, so I decided to go for a shoulder bag instead. For the most part this works our fine, if I&amp;rsquo;m travelling for more than a day, I tend to re-pack in one of the backpacks I have instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>As mentioned before, I&amp;rsquo;ve kinda turned my home lab into some sort of Slack-Ops deal, where various services in my home lab notify me of events in a private Slack channel.
The latest rendition of that, is adding Slack notifications from phpipam. Once phpipam detects a new device picking up an IP in my network, it notifies me like this:
In order to get this working, I had to edit the /var/www/phpipam/functions/scripts/discoveryCheck.</description>

      <title>Running telnetlogger on my home IP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ErrataRob&#34;&gt;Robert Graham&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.erratasec.com&#34;&gt;erratasec&lt;/a&gt; has created a small honeypot tool called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/telnetlogger&#34;&gt;telnetlogger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  This is a simple program to log login attempts on Telnet (port 23).
  It&#39;s designed to track the Mirai botnet. Right now (Oct 23, 2016) infected Mirai machines from around the world are trying to connect to Telnet on every IP address about once per minute. This program logs both which IP addresses are doing the attempts, and which passwords they are using.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those still unaware of what the Mirai botnet is, it&amp;rsquo;s basically malware that scans for vulnerable devices with port 23 (telnet) open to the outside world, and tries to log on with known hardcoded credentials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VMworld Europe 2016 - My takeaways</title>

VMworld Europe 2016 in Barcelona is a couple of weeks old now, and most of the dust has settled. Besides the general announcements around vSphere 6.5 and surrounding products, the next big thing might just be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/radius/cross-cloud-introduction/&#34;&gt;Cross-Cloud Architecture&lt;/a&gt; and of course &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/me-too-vmware-cloud-on-aws/&#34;&gt;VMware Cloud on AWS&lt;/a&gt;. The announcements around vSAN 6.5 (yes, it is now &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/leecaswell/status/790679575499907072&#34;&gt;vSAN and not Virtual SAN/VSAN anymore&lt;/a&gt;), are also very interesting. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time I revisit my earlier &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/vmware-vsan-more-than-meets-the-eye/&#34;&gt;VMware VSAN; More than meets the eye&lt;/a&gt; post and update it for vSAN 6.5?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I set up a public jumphost for my homelab/network, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for an easy way to manage my SSH tunnels. After trying a couple of different managers, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opoet.com/pyro/index.php&#34;&gt;Secure Pipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img src=&#34;https://vninja.net/img/Screenshot-2016-10-14-11.07.46-300x243.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/homelabops-via-slack/&#34;&gt;Slack to alert and log &lt;/a&gt;a few things in my environment, and one of the things I use it for is to alert me if someone logs on via SSH to my public facing Jumphost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a good walkthrough on how to set up such a host, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virtualtothecore.com/en/tunnel-all-your-remote-connections-through-ssh-with-a-linux-jumpbox/&#34;&gt;Tunnel all your remote connections through ssh with a linux jumpbox&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dellock6&#34;&gt;Luca Dell&amp;rsquo;Oca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to a bunch of sessions, and general announcements, but for me the value of attending VMworld is in the networking with other people. Sessions and keynotes can be reviewed later, interacting with others can not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodbye PernixData FVP and Architect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we all know by now, PernixData was &lt;a href=&#34;http://fortune.com/2016/08/28/nutanix-snarfs-up-two-companies-to-bolster-data-center-hardware-story/&#34;&gt;gobbled up by Nutanix&lt;/a&gt; a while back, and since then there has been a nothing but silence on the future of the FVP and Architect products. Now it seems it&amp;rsquo;s over. The acquisition trigged a bunch of PernixData employees moving elsewhere, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the products time to move on as well.

      <title>CloudFlare Dynamic DNS Update Script (cf-ddns.sh)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a part of my&lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/&#34;&gt; Homelab&lt;/a&gt; project, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a proper bash script to provide dynamic DNS updates for external resources, via CloudFlare. More details on the reasoning behind it can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/using-cloudflare-for-dynamic-dns/&#34;&gt;Using CloudFlare for Dynamic DNS&lt;/a&gt;, but since that was posted I&amp;rsquo;ve fleshed the script out quite a bit more.

      <title>Using CloudFlare for Dynamic DNS</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/homelab/using-cloudflare-for-dynamic-dns/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/homelab/dynamic-dns-requirements/&#34;&gt;In my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I tried to lay out the foundation and reasoning behind requiring a Dynamic DNS Service, and here is how I solved it using CloudFlare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I moved my chosen domain name to CloudFlare, and made sure everything resolved ok with static records. Once that was working, I started playing around with the CloudFlare API, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/&#34;&gt;Cocoa Rest Client&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no developer (as is probably very apparent by the script below), nor API wizard of any kind, but it was fairly easy figuring out how to craft a request that lists my DNS zone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic DNS Requirements</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/homelab/dynamic-dns-requirements/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/homelab/dynamic-dns-requirements/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on my new &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/taking-it-to-far/&#34;&gt;Homelab&lt;/a&gt; setup, I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating ways to provide hostname based access to several web services located in my DMZ zone. Since my provider doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide static IP addresses, I also need an external Dynamic DNS service, to provide said hostname mappings through the reverse proxy on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are loads of Dynamic DNS services available, most of them lets you use some sort of predefined domain name scheme, and point it to your external IP, but I wanted to use a domain name that I own and control. Since I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudflare.com&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; to provide DNS services (amongst other things) for this very site, it was a natural choice to see if they could fit the bill for my lab needs as well. Turns out, not only can they provide the services I need for free, they also allow me to play around and have fun at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Veeam vCenter Migration Utility</title>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/veeam-vcenter-migration-utility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in 2013, I published &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/preserve-veeam-br-backups-jobs-moving-vcenter/&#34;&gt;Preserve your Veeam B&amp;amp;R Backups Jobs when Moving vCenter&lt;/a&gt;, outlining how to &amp;laquo;cheat&amp;raquo; (by using a CNAME alias) to preserve your Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication jobs if you replace your VMware vCenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when there is a new vCenter instance, all the Virtual Machine Managed Object Reference&amp;rsquo;s (MoRef) change, which makes Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication start a new backup/replication chain, since all VMs are treated as new ones. Not ideal by any means, but at least you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to recreate all your jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A few days ago I decided to go full-on mad scientist in documenting my new home lab / network setup, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even created a GitHub repository for it.
The idea is to create a framework for developing this kind of documentation, heavily influenced by the VCDX methodology and framework. Over time, Conceptual, Logical and Physical designs will be added, as well as configuration settings and operational procedures. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll also contain some useful diagrams.</description>

      <title>vSphere Platform Services Controller (PSC) topology and Omnigraffle</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/virtualization/vsphere-platform-services-controller-psc-topology-and-omnigraffle/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lamw&#34;&gt;William Lam&lt;/a&gt; published a little python script called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2016/05/generating-vcenter-server-platform-services-controller-deployment-topology-diagrams.html&#34;&gt;extract_vsphere_deployment_topology.py&lt;/a&gt; that basically lets you export your current vSphere PSC topology as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)&#34;&gt;DOT (graph description language)&lt;/a&gt; file. Great stuff, and in itself useful as is, especially if you run it through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webgraphviz.com&#34;&gt;webgraphviz.com&lt;/a&gt; as William suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, you might want to edit the topology map, change colours and fonts, and even move the boxes around, after you get the output. If you have a large environment, you might want to combine all your PSC topologies into a single document? It turns out, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to do!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in late 2014 I volunteered to do technical review for a book called **&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?keyWords=arrasjid&amp;amp;type=&#34;&gt;IT Architect: Foundation in the Art of Infrastructure Design: A Practical Guide for IT Architects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Due to a lot of unforeseen events, the book has been delayed quite a bit, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally available as hardcopy, paperback and eBook! The book is written by &lt;/strong&gt;J**&lt;strong&gt;ohn Yani Arrasjid&lt;/strong&gt;, VCDX-001, &lt;strong&gt;Mark Gabryjelski&lt;/strong&gt;, VCDX-023, &lt;strong&gt;Chris McCain&lt;/strong&gt;, VCDX-079 and as the title states it really does lay out the foundation of how to approach infrastructure design in a modern virtualised data center.

      <description>Yesterday was my first real day as a Senior Solutions Architect for Proact, and today I flew to Oslo for on-boarding and some face-to-face time with my new colleagues over there. By the looks of it, there is a lot of exciting things in the pipeline, and it we land the things we have started on this should be interesting. Very interesting indeed.
In addition to the excitement around changing employers, and roles, some other things have also happened.</description>

      <title>vCenter Server Appliance Backups</title>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/vcenter-server-appliance-backups/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been advocating the usage of VCSA instead of the traditional Microsoft Windows based vCenter. It has feature parity with the Windows version now, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to deploy, gets right-sized out of the box and eliminates the need for an external Microsoft SQL server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the questions I often face when talking about the appliance,_ is how do we handle backups?_  Most customers are comfortable with backup up Windows servers and Microsoft SQL, but quite a few have reservations when it comes to the integrated vPostgres database that the VCSA employs. One common misconception is that a VCSA backup is only crash-consistent. Thankfully vPostgres takes care of this on it&amp;rsquo;s own, by using what it calls &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/continuous-archiving.html&#34;&gt;Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, this requires that you have a VM with for instance an US IP to provide the breakout network, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Ravello Systems comes into the equation. Luckily as a current vExpert I have access to &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/ravello/&#34;&gt;1000 free monthly CPU hours&lt;/a&gt; of personal/lab usage, all with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.ravellosystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/215793017&#34;&gt;choice of regions&lt;/a&gt; to put the VM in. &lt;em&gt;Perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I saw this tweet from Stephen Foskett:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Dear &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/YourDailyTechUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@YourDailyTechUS&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You appear to rip off whole articles from a wide variety of sources. Is your business model based on plagiarism?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Stephen Foskett (@SFoskett) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SFoskett/status/672071591245783042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;December 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which spurred a discussion back and forth, with a few rather interesting statements from yourdailytech.com, like this one&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VMware VSAN - More than meets the eye.</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/virtualization/vmware-vsan-more-than-meets-the-eye/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/vmware-vsan-more-than-meets-the-eye/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in 2014 I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/vsan-unspoken-future/&#34;&gt;VSAN – The Unspoken Future&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time it got a revision. Of course, lots of things have happened to VSAN since then and even more is on the way, but I think there is more to this than adding features like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2015/09/01/virtual-san-beta-coming-up-with-dedupe-and-erasure-coding/&#34;&gt;erasure coding, deduplication&lt;/a&gt; and compression. All of these are important features, and frankly they need to be in a product that aims a lot higher than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a curious by nature, and when my colleagues start talking frantic about some system that has crashed, I get curious and have to ask questions. Usually this ends up in me doing a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- This, however, was not one of those times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a few of you have noticed, I recently changed my title on &lt;a href=&#34;https://no.linkedin.com/in/christianmohn&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Chief Consultant&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Architect&lt;/strong&gt; in the newly formed &lt;a href=&#34;http://evry.no&#34;&gt;EVRY&lt;/a&gt; Cloud Consulting division, but what does that mean and perhaps more importantly, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest description I have found to describe what my new role is this:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VMware Update Manager: Unsupported Configuration</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmware-update-manager-unsupported-configuration/</link>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmware-update-manager-unsupported-configuration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During an upgrade from vSphere 5.1 to 5.5, I ran into a rather strange issue when trying to utilize VMware Update Manager to perform the ESXi upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During scanning, VUM reported the ESXi host as &amp;laquo;Incompatible&amp;raquo;, without offering any other explanation. I spent ages looking through VUM logs, trying to find the culprit, suspecting it was an incompatible VIB. Without finding anything that gave me any indication on what the problem might be, I moved on to looking at the ESXi image I had imported into VUM.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to this, it&amp;rsquo;s also available as an &lt;a href=&#34;http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmw-tools/esxui/esxui-offline-bundle-3015331.zip&#34;&gt;offline bundle&lt;/a&gt; so you can distribute it with Update Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my day in esxcli, here is a quick post on how to perform the upgrade from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/vmware-2/esxi5-5-to-6-0-upgrade-from-local-http-daemon/&#34;&gt;local http repository&lt;/a&gt; hosting the .vib file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently involved with consulting for a Norwegian shipping company who has quite a few remote vSphere installations, most of them with a couple of ESXi hosts, but no vCenter and hence no Update Manager. While looking at methods for managing these installations, in particular how to facilitate patching and upgrading scenarios, I remembered that way back in 2013, I posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/quick-and-dirty-http-based-deployment/&#34;&gt;Quick and Dirty HTTP-based Deployment&lt;/a&gt; which shows how to use the Python to run a simple http daemon, and serve files from it.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-history&#34;&gt;Problem History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work at a school district in the US (Kansas City area). After the school year ended, my Director decided he wanted to upgrade to vSphere6 from vSphere55U2 on a few Hosts we were using with XenApp. We are using XenApp to deliver apps to student labs that utilize an Autocad program. As such, our Hosts also have a graphics card in them – nVIDIA GRID K1. To give the students a bit more graphics power this upcoming school year, we added a 2nd nVIDIA card to each Host. The Hosts are HP Proliant DL380p Gen8 with Intel Xeon X5650 2.67GHz processors and about 296GB RAM. Since we added a 2nd nVIDIA card, we also needed to upgrade the Host power supplies to support the 2 cards’ power consumption (1200W support).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I almost choked on my coffee this morning when I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2015/08/new-html5-embedded-host-client-for-esxi.html&#34;&gt;William Lam announcing a new VMware Fling&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&#34;https://labs.vmware.com/flings/esxi-embedded-host-client&#34;&gt;ESXi Embedded Host Client&lt;/a&gt;. Finally the day when we can get a local vSphere Web Client on a standalone host is here, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a moment too soon. This feature has been missing since ESX 3 and it&amp;rsquo;s VMware Infrastructure Web Access. For now, this is a Fling (which means unsupported and so on), but I really hope that this ends up being built-in to ESXi very soon &amp;ndash; even on the free vSphere Hypervisor.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;For the third time in a week, researchers have discovered a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash Player browser plugin. Like the previous two discoveries, this one came to light only after hackers dumped online huge troves of documents stolen from Hacking Team — an Italian security firm that sells software exploits to governments around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent months, and weeks, has made me question the value of the &amp;laquo;vCommunity&amp;raquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m even questioning if there really is such a thing at all any more. I believe there was such a thing at one point, but it seems to be fading fast into history, only to be replaced by hyperbole of &lt;em&gt;egonormous&lt;/em&gt; proportions. Back in the old days, and this might just be me showing my greying of beards moment, the hyperbole wasn&amp;rsquo;t a strong a force as it seems to be today. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait&#34;&gt;clickbait&lt;/a&gt; replaces journalism, hyperbole and FUD seems to be replacing what used to be based on technical merit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2015/03/downloading-vmware-suite-push-button-using-vmware-software-manager.html&#34;&gt;VMware Software Manager&lt;/a&gt;, which was released at the same time as vSphere 6, is a great way to get your download ducks in a row, and not manually download all the different vSphere pieces one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all these downloads sure eat up disk space, and if you, like me, chose the wrong download location while installing VMware Software Manager what do you do? &lt;del&gt;There is no way in the web interface to change the download directory after installation, so how do you change it? &lt;/del&gt;There is a way through the GUI as well, but here is how to do it manually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the Norwegian VMUG up and running was a long process. I decided to have a go at it, and I spent a lot of time talking to people, thinking, planning and generally wondering how we could get it started and how to proceed. Some might say an inordinate amount of time, and they are right. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have talented and passionate people on board with me for this, this is not something I have done on my own. But, someone had to get the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my work as a consultant I often have many small tasks to perform for customers, all while completing a bigger project. I have found that an easy way to keep track of all the little and big changes, is to create a ChangeLog. Normally ChangeLog&amp;rsquo;s are referenced in development projects, but it also sense to use it to track of your own, or your team members, changes to an infrastructure environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/markdown-things/&#34;&gt;just about everything else&lt;/a&gt;, I use Markdown to make it easy to format and edit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The VMware Certified Design Expert: &lt;strong&gt;VCDX&lt;/strong&gt;. THE certification of certifications, especially if you work with VMware based solutions. It&amp;rsquo;s often regarded as the holy grail of certifications, and rightfully so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But why is this the case, and why does &amp;laquo;everyone&amp;raquo; want to become one?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for it being such a highly coveted title, are pretty obvious:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The vSphere 6.0 Launch and The Misinformation Effect</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/vsphere-6-0-launch-misinformation-effect/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what happens if you give 10.000 people access to an open-beta that is supposed to be under &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement&#34;&gt;NDA&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the NDA is no-go from the get-go. There is no way you can claim that you actually expect 10.000 people to not talk about something they know about. VMware vSpere 6.0 was the worst kept secret ever, for a reason. It might have been planned that way all along for all I know, but if that was the case, the NDA should never have been in place to begin with.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ajauch&#34;&gt;Alex Jauch&lt;/a&gt;, VAIO Product Manager has provided &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/virtualization/dude-vaio/#comment-16019&#34;&gt;an update&lt;/a&gt; on why there there has been so little information available, and when to expect that to change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, the cat formerly known as vSphere.next is finally out of it&amp;rsquo;s rather big bag, and vSphere 6.0 has been officially announced and will be available some time in Q1 (no date has been announced yet). There is &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2015/02/vsphere-6-0-vexpert-blog-articles.html&#34;&gt;enough of posts&lt;/a&gt; going into details on what is new and what has been announced, so I won&amp;rsquo;t be going over that right now. If you want to hear me talk about vSphere 6.0 and related news, you can always attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://vmug.no/pamelding-vmug-bergen-19-februar/&#34;&gt;VMUG Norway on the 19th of february&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently set up a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html&#34;&gt;Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication v8&lt;/a&gt; demo lab, and my intial small job that consisted of two different Linux VMs and one Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller was chugging along nicely. I had one minor from the start though, and that was that file indexing consistently failed for the Windows VM. No big deal, but I thought it was strange at the time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2015: Let&#39;s DOS IT!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Scott Lowe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/16/looking-ahead-2015-projects/&#34;&gt;Looking Ahead: My 2015 Projects&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t post anything like this in 2014, I can&amp;rsquo;t really go back and see how my plans turned out, or provide any assessement of it. I can say this though, 2014 was pretty awesome. I got a promotion, my vExpert status was renewed, vNinja was voted in the top 50 of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vsphere-land.com/news/2014-top-vmware-virtualization-blog-voting-results.html&#34;&gt;2014 top VMware &amp;amp; virtualization vote&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-veeam®-backup-replication-vmware-vsphere&#34;&gt;published a book&lt;/a&gt; and finally got the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vmug.no&#34;&gt;Norwegian VMUG&lt;/a&gt; up and running. My VCAP-DCA 550 should be on this list as well, and so should my failure in achieving VCAP-DCD certification status. 2014 was also the busiest year in &lt;a href=&#34;http://vNinja.net&#34;&gt;vNinja.net&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s history, with close to a doubling of traffic generated through the year. The same goes for &lt;a href=&#34;http://vSoup.net&#34;&gt;vSoup&lt;/a&gt;, some of the episodes we recorded in 2014 had some rather insane listening numbers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obviously I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late to the party here, but I guess late is better than never. It recently dawned on me that mucking about with lots of different file formats, interfaces and ways of doing things is rather counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of my work these days are related to generating content, be it a simple blog post like this or writing customer proposals and documentation. In the end, the deliverables are often quite different, but at the core they are strangely enough very similar. After all, the main thing is content, right? The file format itself, or how it is generated, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have a bearing on the content at all, it&amp;rsquo;s just a delivery method. Lipstick on a pig, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m playing around a bit with vCloud Air and Virtual Private Cloud OnDemand, and in order to set up the vCloud Hybrid Service plugin in the vSphere Web Client you need to import the vCloud Air SSL certificate into vCenter. If the certificate isn&amp;rsquo;t present in the vCSA keystore when you try to authenticate with vCloud Air, you get a &amp;laquo;&lt;strong&gt;Server Certificate not Verified&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;raquo; error, and you will be unsuccessful in configuring the plugin.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/DeepStorageNet&#34;&gt;Howard Marks&lt;/a&gt; has published a post I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning do myself, but to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m glad Howard put it out there. His is way more researched and comprehensive than mine would ever have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkcomputing.com/storage/the-true-cost-of-hyperconvergence/a/d-id/1317768?_mc=sm_nwc&#34;&gt;The True Cost Of Hyperconvergence&lt;/a&gt; article, Howard compares buying a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/evorail&#34;&gt;EVO:RAIL&lt;/a&gt; system, with building your own. Complete with the required hardware, licenses and support contracts. The result might come as a surprise to some&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

Sadly it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make it this year, but don&amp;rsquo;t let that stop &lt;strong&gt;you! &lt;/strong&gt;While we in Norway are still trying to get our local VMUG up and running, more news on that in a very short while, the danish VMUG is really the driving force and the leading star for the rest of us in the nordics.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VMware Studio 2.6 was released way back in March 2012,  and surprisingly there seems to be no new update in sight. While VMware Studio technically still works, even with newer versions of ESXi and vCenter, the supported operating systems for the appliances it can build is &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; outdated:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Hyperconverged the be-all, end-all? No.</title>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/rant/hyperconverged-be-all-end-all-no/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, this is not meant to be a post negating the value of current hyperconverged solutions available in the market. I think hyperconverged has it&amp;rsquo;s place, and for many use cases it makes perfect sense to go down that route. But the idea that everyone should go hyperconverged and all data should be placed on local drives, even if made redundant inside the chassis and even between chassis, is to be blunt, a bit silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts of this post is inspired by a recent discussion on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lamw/status/512239798191284224&#34;&gt;William Lam had the same idea&lt;/a&gt;, and got a new Knowledgebase Article published: &lt;a href=&#34;http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2089791&#34;&gt;Download URLs for VMware vSphere Client (2089791)&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>I finally took the plunge, and sat the VDCA550 exam yesterday. The VCAP5-DCA certification has been on my todo list way to long, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I can now tick that box and move on.
The VDCA550 exam is held in a live lab environment, with approximately 23 lab activities, which is the subsequently scored after the exam is finished. This means that you do not get an immediate pass/fail summary at the end of the exam, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be feverishly checking your email until the score report is sent to you from VMware.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another VMworld US is over, with huge attendee numbers and in keeping with tradition lots of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viktorious.nl/2014/09/01/vmworld-2014-announcements/&#34;&gt;new announcements&lt;/a&gt; were made.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go through them, enough posts have been made about that, the basis of this post is something completely different all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a general expectation that we as a community is to be wooed by the announcements and flashy keynotes, but are we really the target audience? If you think about it, we probably aren&amp;rsquo;t.

&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m not at VMworld my self, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the blog postings to those close to the action, but here is a quick collection of links to get you acquainted with the next &lt;strong&gt;EVO&lt;/strong&gt;lution of SDDC from VMware:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a way to put two of my favourite things together in a completely non-sensical way, namely VMware Marvin and Pearl Jam. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/20/vmware_seeks_two_new_hardwarerelated_trademarks/?mt=1408660085798&#34;&gt;The Register reported earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, odds are that Marvin no longer responds to it&amp;rsquo;s project name, but rather to the new EVO name recently trademarked by VMware. There has been whispers of a Marvin name change for quite some time, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t really hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer of mine, who runs a pure HP environment based on c7000 and StoreServ 7200, wanted to get the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A93zVmnheEE&#34;&gt;HP Insight Control Storage Module for vCenter&lt;/a&gt; up and running. The problem was that while we were able to connect to the older MSA array they run for non-production workloads, we were unable to connect to the newer StoreServ 7200. There is full IP connectivity between the application server that the HP Insight components run on and the storage controllers/VSP (no firewalls between them, they are located in the same subnet).

      <title>Is Marvin an Acronym?</title>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmwares-mystic-marvin-project/&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/vmware-2/marvin-speculation/&#34;&gt;speculations&lt;/a&gt; surrounding Marvin has now hit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/10/vmware_to_build_converged_compute_and_storage_ihardwarei/&#34;&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt; (to bad they don&amp;rsquo;t link this way, but I guess thats how it is) as well, but one piece is still missing, arguably the most important one. We all know that the most important piece of something like this is it&amp;rsquo;s name, or acronym, not it&amp;rsquo;s technical merit&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a few attempts at guessing what Marvin is an acronym for,  and here are some good ones from twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How long as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/nsx_pubs.html&#34;&gt;NSX for vSphere 6.0.4 Documentation &lt;/a&gt;been publicly available? I just noticed this, and that the NSX downloads seem to be available via MyVMware - If you are entitled to it that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vninja.net/img/Download-VMware-NSX.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vninja.net/img/Download-VMware-NSX-1024x546.png&#34; alt=&#34;Download VMware NSX&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean it will be available for download and we get to play with it soon-ish? It might have been available earlier too, unnoticed by yours truly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After close to a full day of Twitter speculations and discussions on what &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmwares-mystic-marvin-project/&#34;&gt;Marvin really is&lt;/a&gt;, some thoughts kept stuck with me, and this is my attempt at articulating what I think VMware might be up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Please note that I have no real knowledge of the status of the project, nor if it really exists outside of a poster in a window in the VMware campus. All I do know is that there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://trademarks.justia.com/861/60/marvin-86160864.html&#34;&gt;trademark registered&lt;/a&gt;, and that there seems to be some merit behind the speculations done by &lt;a href=&#34;30/project-mystics-potential-competitors-to-vmware-bring-it-on.htm&#34;&gt;CRN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/19/emc_sailing_up_the_mystic_river/&#34;&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, as far as I know, the first public sighting confirming the existence of the &amp;laquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crn.com/news/data-center/300071991/sources-vmware-building-project-mystic-converged-infrastructure-appliance-for-emc.htm&#34;&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;raquo; project Marvin that VMware is working on. The text reads &amp;laquo;&lt;em&gt;Introducing the worlds first 100% VMware powered hyper converged infrastructure appliance&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;raquo; I guess some of the VMware engineers forgot that the VMware campus get external visitors from time to time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is it? Well, there aren&amp;rsquo;t many details available but &lt;a href=&#34;http://trademarks.justia.com/861/60/marvin-86160864.html&#34;&gt;Marvin is indeed a registered trademark&lt;/a&gt;, by VMware. According to the trademark registration, it&amp;rsquo;s purpose is pretty clear:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A little over a month ago I announced the Want to Win a Google Chromecast contest and finally the winner has been selected. Since there was a grand total of 5 submissions, and one of them was immediately disqualified for a distinct lack of Ninja-presence, I decided to just do a random draw.
The submitted photos were numbered by the order they appeared in on my post as I took this screenshot.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While upgrading a vShield Manager 5.1.1 install to 5.1.4 at a client, I ran into an issue with logging in after a completed upgrade. The username and password used to log in, and subsequently upload the upgrade file, was no longer working after the upgrade finished and the vShield Manager appliance had been rebooted.

      <title>VSAN - The Unspoken Future</title>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/vsan-unspoken-future/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This rather &lt;em&gt;tongue-in-cheek&lt;/em&gt; title, is a play on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maishsk/&#34;&gt;Maish &lt;/a&gt;recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://technodrone.blogspot.com/2014/03/vsan-unspoken-truth.html&#34;&gt;VSAN - The Unspoken Truth&lt;/a&gt; post where he highlights what he thinks is one of the hidden &amp;laquo;problems&amp;raquo; with the current version of VSAN is it&amp;rsquo;s inherent non-blade compatibility and current lack of &amp;laquo;rack based VSAN ready nodes&amp;raquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a reality; If you base your current infrastructure on blade servers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/virtual-san&#34;&gt;VSAN&lt;/a&gt; probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a good match as it stands today. Chances are that if you are currently running a blade-based datacenter, you have traditional external storage on the back end of that, and that you for quite some time will be running a form factor that VSAN simply isn&amp;rsquo;t designed for. I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with Maish in that conclusion, not a bit.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vninja.net/img/VCP5.png#floatright&#34; alt=&#34;VCP5&#34; /&gt;VMware has announced a Recertification Policy for it&amp;rsquo;s VMware Certified Professional program, effective as of March 10, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it means that you are no longer a VCP(x) for life, but need to recertify every 2 years, unless you take a VCAP exam during the same period. If you do not upgrade your certification, your VCP status is revoked. For all the details, have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=46667&amp;amp;ui=www_cert&#34;&gt;Recertification Policy: VMware Certified Professional&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Configuring VSAN on a Dell PowerEdge VRTX</title>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/poweredge-vrtx/pd&#34;&gt;Dell PowerEdge VRTX shared infrastructure platform&lt;/a&gt; is interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to be able to borrow one from Dell for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I wanted to test, was if it was possible to run &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/virtual-san&#34;&gt;VMware VSAN&lt;/a&gt; on it, even if the Shared PERC8 RAID controller it comes with is not on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php&#34;&gt;VMware VSAN HCL&lt;/a&gt;, nor does it provide a method to do passthrough to present raw disks directly to the hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of hooking up to an existing quotes database, I simply made my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have collected a few VCDX related tips and quotes, primarily from the archive &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/DuncanYB&#34;&gt;Duncan Epping&lt;/a&gt; put together of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/10/01/vcdx-tips-from-vcdx-001-john-arrasjid/&#34;&gt;VCDX Tips from VCDX 001 John Arrasjid&lt;/a&gt;, but also from the &amp;laquo;submissions&amp;raquo; I got from &lt;a href=&#34;http://vninja.net/news/vcdx-give-quote/&#34;&gt;VCDX?

_All I&amp;rsquo;m asking is that you provide me with a single line quote about the VCDX process, or the VCDX program itself. _
Please send any quotes to me on Twitter, either as a mention or as a DM, your choice. Once I have a handful of quotes available, they will be made public for others to use as well&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During some way overdue housekeeping in my HP Microserver-based &amp;laquo;Homelab&amp;raquo; today, I ran into a rather annoying issue that prevented me from starting one of my more important VMs; namely my home Domain Controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I removed an old SSD drive that I&amp;rsquo;ve used for vFlash Read Cache (vFRC) testing and installed a new 1TB drive instead. Since I have a rather beefy work lab now, I need space more than speed at home, so this seemed like a good idea at the time.

The event itself can only be described as a mini-VMworld, with over 600 registered attendees, and a speaker list worthy of such a nick-name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening keynote was held by Joe Baguley, the closing keynote was held by Chad Sakac. In between those two, you had the possibility to attend sessions held by Cormac Hogan, Mike Laverick,  Frank Brix, Paudie O-Riordan, Frank Denneman, Mattias Sundling, David Davis and Duncan Epping.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time during the &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcastingforcancer.org&#34;&gt;Podcasting for Cancer&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser period I somehow suggested that we should pair it with this years &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.movember.com&#34;&gt;Movember&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my wife and daughters strenuous protests, I signed up and went all in. By all in, I mean, all in. For the first time since I went to my then employers christmas party dressed as a woman, I shaved my whole face.

      <description>Yeah, I admit it. I want OS X Mavericks, and I want it now.
Unfortunately, it´s not available yet from Software Update. So instead of manually checking every 5 minutes or so, I decided to create a small bash script that does it for me.
It´s very, very simple, but I think it does the job:
First off, pop into Terminal and get root access:
h0bbel::h0bair { ~ }-&amp;gt; sudo su - Then create a small bash script, I named mine update.</description>

      <description>For the first time since 2010 I will actually be physically attending VMworld Europe! I fly over from the very cold, rainy and generally very autumny Norway to sunny Barcelona on Sunday the 13th.
Based on my past experience from VMworld in Copenhagen, I have decided to go easy on the session scheduling and not fill my calendar to the brim.
Sure, the sessions provide insane amounts of useful content, but for me the main reason to attend VMworld is to physically meet up and talk to a lot of the people I usually spend a lot of time communicating with.</description>

      <description>With the new vSphere 5.5 release, the VMware vCenter Appliance (vCSA) has grown up to be a viable alternative to the traditional Microsoft Windows based vCenter deployment scenario. The new vCSA version supports up to 100 hosts and 3000 (with an external Oracle database the values change to 1000/10000) virtual machines, a big improvement from 5 hosts and 50 virtual machines in the previous version.
Sadly, the only external database option available for vCSA 5.</description>

Straight forward procedure, but there is one small caveat in this process.
One important thing to remember, and something I don´t feel that the knowledge-base article highlights well enough is that the new v5.</description>

      <description>One of the new features in vSphere 5.5 is the vSphere vFlash that enables you to use a SSD/Flash device as a read cache for your storage. Duncan Epping has a series of posts on vSphere Flash Cache that is well worth a read.
vSphere vFlash caches your read IOs, but at the same time you can use it as a swap device if you run into memory contention issues. The vSphere vFlash Host Cache is similar to the older Host Cache feature, but if you are upgrading from an older version of ESXi there is a couple of things that needs to be done to be able to use this feature.</description>

      <description>While deploying a fresh vCenter Server 5.5 Appliance, I ran into an issue getting it configured.
When the appliance is deployed, the first time you log in you get presented with the configuration wizard. The wizard clearly states that if you want to set a static ip, or hostname, you should cancel the wizard, do the network configuration and then re-run the wizard after the fact.
Well, that´s what I did, and it resulted in the following error when trying to create the embedded database:</description>

      <description>As I´ve posted about earlier, you can update your ESXi hosts to a new release from the command line. Now that ESXi 5.5 has been released, the same procedure can be applied to upgrade once more.
Place the host in maintenance mode, then run the following command to do an online update to ESXi 5.5:
~ # esxcli software profile update -d https://hostupdate.vmware.com/software/VUM/PRODUCTION/main/vmw-depot-index.xml -p ESXi-5.5.0-1331820-standard While this runs, monitor the log file to check upgrade process:</description>

      <description>As Eric Siebert has pointed out, the VMware vSphere release cycles are shortening.
While vSphere 5.1 could be seen as a bit rushed, especially in regards to SSO, when it was released, the shorter release cycles seem to work out pretty well.
This does make me think though; vSphere 5.5 is pretty much ready to be released to the general public, and the new VSAN component will be in a public beta at the same time.</description>

      <description>About a year and a half I go, I took the leap from running Microsoft Windows as my main operating system and switched into full &amp;laquo;hipster mode&amp;raquo;, i.e. switched to a Macbook Air and OS X.
Simply put, &amp;laquo;the change&amp;raquo; was not that hard and most everything has worked without problems, and for those things that still require Microsoft Windows, well, there is VMware Fusion for that.
While I´m admittedly still a novice OS X user, and not even close to mastering OS X, I´d like to share my current Slate setup.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the ESXi Upgrade Process</title>

      <description>When doing manual host upgrades, either through the direct method or via a locally placed upgrade bundle, there is a distinct lack of progress information available after running the esxcli command.
Thankfully the ESXi host provides a running logfile of the upgrade process, which makes it much easier to keep track of what is going on and that the upgrade is indeed being performed.
The esxupdate.log is located in /var/log, and by issuing the following command in a terminal window you can have a rolling log showing you the upgrade status and progress:</description>

      <description>A fellow IT-professional, who works with the non-wired flavor of networking, contacted me with the following scenario:
A group of users, developers in this case, have VMware Workstation installed on their laptops. This makes it easy for them to manage, test and develop their applications in a closed environment without having to install a bunch of tools/services on their centrally managed laptop environment. An excellent use case for VMware Workstation if there ever was one.</description>

      <description>When configuring a new C7000 Blade Enclosure with a couple of FlexFabric 10Gb/24-port modules I ran into a rather annoying issue during setup.
HP Virtual Connect 3.70 introduced support for Direct-Attach setups of HP 3Par StoreServ 7000 storage systems, where you can eliminate the need for dedicated FC switches. For full details, have a look at Implementing HP Virtual Connect Direct-Attach Fibre Channel with HP 3PAR StoreServ Systems.
This is excellent for setups where all your hosts are HP Blades, and you have a Virtual Connect FlexFabric setup.</description>

      <description>A lot of the scripted installation tools that VMware offers allows the usage of a central HTTP based repository for hosting the files. Today I stumbled over a little gem that might just help you create a &amp;laquo;quick and dirty&amp;raquo; HTTP based deployment scenario by running a simple command in your terminal. By default, this command works on any system that has Python installed on it, so OS X and Linux should be ready to go as is.</description>

      <description>Now that VMware ESXi 5.1 Update 1 has been released I decided to do a quick and dirty upgrade of my home installation. I refuse to call it a lab these days, since it´s one singular host and all it does it contain my home domain controller&amp;hellip;
Anyway, the following procedure upgraded the host from 5.1b to 5.1U1, by downloading the upgrade directly from VMware and installing it. Make sure the host is in maintenance mode before attempting this procedure.</description>

      <description>While building my lab environment, I ran into a situation where I wanted to have a completely sealed off networking segment that had no outside access.
This is a trivial task on it`s own, just create a vSwitch with no physical NICs attached to it, and then connect the VMs to it. The VMs will then have interconnectivity, but no outside network access at all.
In this particular case, I was setting up a couple of nested ESXi servers that I wanted to connect to the &amp;laquo;outside&amp;raquo; vCenter Appliance (VCSA).</description>

I will not cover the network setup part of the equation, but rather go through the simple steps required to get the MEM installed on the hosts in question.
First of all, you need to download the MEM installation package. At the time of writing, the latest version is v1.</description>

      <description>Duncan Epping rather unceremoniously published a blog post &amp;laquo;New Beta Program offering: VMware Hosted Beta&amp;raquo; yesterday, outlining the availability of the new hosted beta offering that companions some of the current VMware beta programs.
_Due to the very NDA nature of the beta programs, I can´t really go into details on what is currently offered, but what I can say is this: Well done VMware!_
The VMware Hosted Beta runs on the same engine that runs the VMware Hands on Labs Online – Beta, but with a little added twist.</description>

      <description>It´s a well known problem that with Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Recovery Replication 6.5, and earlier, backing up the SQL server that hosts the vCenter DB poses a problem. KB1051 VSS for vCenter outlines the issue well, and provides a workaround.
If you experience this problem, you will see entries like this in your Veeam B&amp;amp;R backup logs:
 Veeam vCenterDB Backup Error
The workaround provided by Veeam is to create host VM-Host Affinity Rules, effectively pinning a VM to a given host, and then perform the VM backup through the host rather than through the vCenter.</description>

      <description>This week I´m working at a client site, upgrading their entire existing vSphere 4.1 infrastructure to vSphere 5.1. The customer engagement also includes upgrading Veeam Backup and Replication 6.0 to 6.5, and usually an isolated upgrade of Veeam B&amp;amp;R is a no-brainer next, next, next, done install.
To complicate things in this particular environment, I also had to migrate the vCenter SQL DB from a local MS SQL Server 2005 Express instance to a full-fledged MS SQL Server 2008 R2 instance.</description>

Unlike Flint´s inventions, this one actually makes sense and serves a purpose!
Now, how sweet would it be to deploy Autolab without having to invest time, money and effort into acquiring your own hardware?
Well, thanks to baremetalcloud.com, you might now actually be able to do just that (and more, if you wish).</description>

The new pricing is very attractive, especially since you no longer need to buy access on a course by course basis.
The courses are delivered in your browser, but Trainsignal also offers an offline player in case you need access when traveling or otherwise offline.</description>

      <description>VMware Labs has released a new fling called Makyo (魔境 _makyō_ means “ghost cave” or “devil’s cave.”) which basically is a tool to copy VMs or vApps from one vCenter instance to another.
It works by doing an automated OVF export on the source vCenter, and then an import on the destination vCenter.

The plugin integrates directly into the vSphere Web Client, and I hope to see this feature installed by default in future versions of the Web Client.</description>

      <description>My recent experience with setting up vCenter Operations Manager on a standalone ESXi host, and the always excellent William Lam´s post Automating VCSA Network Configurations For Greenfield Deployments got me thinking.
There are several other appliances out there that require deployment to a vCenter, to be able to configure the networking options and not just default to DHCP. In many, and perhaps even most, cases you can work around that by running the _vami_set_network _command to change from DHCP to STATIC network configurations.</description>

In this case the original vCenter 5.0 Appliance was turned shut down, a new 5.1 Appliance deployed, with the same IP as the old one, and then configured. Naturally the existing hosts were added to the fresh vCenter, clusters recreated and in general everything was reconfigured.</description>

      <description>In order to be able to deploy vCenter Operations Manager, the ESXi host it is deployed to needs to be managed by a vCenter. At first glance, that seems like a fair and pretty straight forward requirement, right? But, is it?
While I can see the need for a vCenter in the environment that vCenter Operations Manager is supposed to monitor, I don´t understand why the host you want to deploy the vApp on has to be managed by a vCenter instance as well?</description>

      <description>One of the smaller improvements in vSphere 5 was the introduction of the &amp;laquo;Virtual machine disks consolidation is needed&amp;raquo; configuration alert if vSphere determines that there are orphaned snapshots for a given VM.

Previous versions does not show this warning message, and datastore usage could potentially skyrocket for no apparent reason if something continues to create snapshots that are not properly cleaned up when they are no longer in use.</description>

      <description>The new vCenter Operations Manager 5.6 is now generally available, and one of many improvements from v5.5 is the new licensing scheme.
The new foundation edition, is the new entry-level edition which from now on is included in every licensed vSphere edition free of charge. That´s right, you can now run vCenter Operations Manager 5.6 Foundation without purchasing any additional licenses.
vCenter Operations Manager now comes in the following flavors:</description>

      <title>Exporting vCenter Events with PowerCLI</title>

      <description>One of my clients has recently been having issues with their storage solution, and wanted to export the events from vCenter that show storage performance degradation, to aid in troubleshooting with the vendor.
For some reason, and I have yet to confirm that this is a bug with the vCenter 5.0 appliance or the vCenter Desktop Client, when an event export is done, the storage related events are not exported with the rest of the events.</description>

      <title>Why Did the HP BL460c G8 Lose It&#39;s Datastore?</title>
      <link>https://vninja.net/vmware-2/hp-bl460c-g8-lose-its-datastore/</link>

      <description>Post Update: As per Preetam´s comment, HP has published a customer advisory regarding the usage of install vs update.
After installing a couple of brand new HP ProLiant BL460c G8 blades with HP Smart Array P220i controllers at a customer site, I decided that I should upgrade from the VMware-ESXi-5.0.0-Update1-623860-HP-5.20.43.iso Build 623860 used to install the blades, to the latest 821926 build offered by VMware.
Normally this is a really easy process using VMware Update Manager, but since this is a new installation all the prerequisites for that are not in place just yet and I decided to use esxcli to perform the update.</description>

      <description>When VMware vSphere 5.1 and vCloud Networking and Security 5.1 was launched at VMworld US in late August, one of the news items was the change in licensing relating to vShield Endpoint.
vShield Endpoint is now included in every vSphere edition, with the exception of the lowest tier vSphere Essentials package.
I was under the impression that you had to upgrade to the new 5.1 version to take advantage of the licensing change, and get licenses available for vShield Endpoint, but a new VMware Knowledgebase article named KB: 2036875 Downloading and enabling vShield Endpoint on supported vSphere platforms debunks that.</description>

      <description>Everyone, and probably their extended family including their mother-in-law, has heard me whine and complain about the VCP training requirements.
VMware has unveiled a new lab, namely Project Nee (Next-Generation Education Environment)
and this is something I´m really excited about.
Project Nee is described as this:
VMware Project NEE is a new VMware Labs project providing a richly featured, powerful online learning and lab environment delivered from the cloud to any device, anywhere, anytime.</description>

      <description>This post is inspired by a tweet from Andrew Storrs, where he pinpoints that the host log file locations have changed between ESXi 4 and ESXi 5.
Note: This post has been updated with new log files for ESXi 5.1
ESXi 4 Log File Locations: [table id=6 /]
ESXi 5 Log File Locations: [table id=5 /]
Between version 5.0 and 5.1 the log file locations have not changed, but a couple of new logs have been added.</description>

      <description>Now that vSphere 5.1 and assorted products have been released into the wild, how do you check the integrity of your downloaded file? As you might be aware of, VMware publishes both MD5 and SHA1 hashes for their files, making it possible to check if the file you just downloaded is identical to the file offered from VMware.
Checking the MD5 or SHA1 hash for a single file is easy, at least in OS X where you don´t need any third party tools to check.</description>

The problems with brain dumps, lack of experience and testing methods is not new, and the_ &amp;laquo;Paper MCSE&amp;raquo;_ term was coined back in the early 2000´s when the influx of newly certified Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers, with little or no real world experience flooded the market.</description>

My iPhone buzzing on the sink caught my attention a few minutes into it. Covered in soap and the rest censored for the public here I answered the call. Without getting into too many details of my organization - my bosses-bossess-boss contacted me reporting a fire in one of our server rooms in Shanghai China.</description>

      <description>VMware Offers vCloud “Test-Drive” with New Evaluation Service.
This announcement doesn´t seem to be &amp;laquo;Project Zephyr&amp;raquo; which, if the rumors are true, is VMware´s own fully fledged IaaS service.
This Public vCloud “Test-Drive” service, which VMware themselves describe as “white-label” from a vCloud service provider, seems like a way for VMware to provide cheap test-drive access, to vCloud through their existing service providers.
Where the rumored &amp;laquo;Project Zephyr&amp;raquo; might be seen as a competing service, Public vCloud looks to be engineered to drive long term customers to the existing ecosystem of providers.</description>

      <description>Mike Laverick and Barry Coombs has released their new book, elegantly titled &amp;laquo;Building End-User Computing Solutions with VMware View&amp;raquo;.
Not only is this a great book, it is something that every existing and potential VMware View (and related technologies in the EUC area) administrator should add to their (digital) bookshelves.
I´ll let the authors themselves describe it:
This book is all about VMware View 5.1 and ThinApp 4.7.2 administration - and it takes in a wide scope of complementary technologies from the likes of Teradici, BitDefender and F5 Networks.</description>

Until now, my main focus has been basic usage of the hardware and operating systems, and making it work in my corporate environment. As I feel that I´ve reached mission accomplished status on that initial project, I decided to use some of my &amp;laquo;free&amp;raquo; vacation time to play around a bit and experiment a bit more.</description>

Thankfully the guys behind vBrownBags has teamed up with VMware communities and are now offering this opportunity at VMworld 2012.</description>

Today VMware has sent out notifications to VMworld 2012 session submitters, with a yay or nay email. Of course, this sparked a lot of conversation on Twitter, and Scott Lowe published a blog post proposing a VMworld Unconference, and exploring several options:
 A physical “unconference”
 A virtual “unconference”

      <description>The Thinapped vSphere Client has finally been updated to v5.0, and is readily available for download!
Sadly the new version is v5.0 only, and will only allow you to connect to vSphere v5 hosts and since the new release has replaced the old release on the VMware Fling website, you´re out of luck if you haven´t already got the 4.0 version stowed away in your own private locker.
I hope VMware decides to either make the 4.</description>

Update 17th September 2014: VMware has published the official list in knowledge base article KB2089791, use that as the official list going forward.
Remember, the client download URL is still available from the vCenter server, if you point your browser to it.</description>

      <description>As Mr. Simon Seagrave has pointed out, there is a fix available to enable OSX Lion Time Machine support for Iomega IX2 and IX4 NAS storage devices.
I decided to take this a little step further, and try to upgrade my old (and discontinued) Iomega IX2-200 to the new IX2-200 Cloud Edition firmware.
Initially this was a big failure, as I seemingly managed to brick my device. It was only responding to pings (so the TCP/IP stack was loaded and working), but I could not bring up the web based management tool nor connect via telnet or SSH.</description>

      <description>My new colleague Olav Tvedt asked me if I could test his method of enabling Bitlocker in a VM, on VMware vSphere. Of course, I was happy to oblige.
I followed the same steps as he did in his Running Bitlocker on a Virtual computer post, and it worked perfectly.
The only real difference between doing this in Hyper-V and on ESXi, is that the virtual floppy drive on ESXi by default doesn&amp;rsquo;t emulate an empty floppy.</description>

      <description>Sammy Bogaert has posted a 12 part series called &amp;laquo;Building The Ultimate vSphere Lab&amp;raquo;, which knocks the socks of my previous vSphere 4.x series.
In reality this means that my planned series for vSphere 5.x is now cancelled, as there is no need to duplicate Sammy&amp;rsquo;s efforts. Be sure to check the series out!</description>

      <description>Yes, this is YAEotYP, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve already read tons of them I apologize.
2011 - My personal view 2011 has been a steamroller of a year.The vSoup Virtualization Podcast got aired the first time, and we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded and published 19 full episodes in the inaugural year. I was awarded the vExpert title for the first time, and even got invited to Tech Field Day #6 in Boston.
In addition to this, I wrote a white paper for Veeam, was included in the Server Virtualization Advisory Board, joined Rick Vanover for a Veeam Community Podcast, and appeared in two video interviews.</description>

      <description>One of the last projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with at Seatrans, is to automate the installation and configuration of vSphere ESXi 5 hosts for deployment on vessels. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a bit about this before, both on vSoup and in Setting Up Automated ESXi Deployments where I outlined my PXE and PowerCLI based installation and configuration scheme. Not much has changed since then, except updating the PXE server to offer ESXi 5, instead of ESXi 4 and a lot of work has been put into the scripting, including a front-end GUI for the PowerCLI script itself.</description>

      <description>While using ThinApp to create a standalone version of TweetDeck 0.38.2, since the newly announced 1.0 version looks, acts and feels like a 0.1 version, I posed the following question on Twitter:
[&#34;Hrm, what other apps should i #ThinApp while I&#39;m at it?&#34;](https://twitter.com/#!/h0bbel/status/145249562490179585). Kevin Kelling immediately responded with &amp;laquo;Doom&amp;raquo;.
Naturally, I decided to give it a go. A quick download of ZDoom later, and a quick run through the ThinApp Setup Capture later, the following was born (view in full screen for better viewing):</description>

      <description>A little while ago I fitted a small 64GB SSD disk to my HP MicroServer just to have a quick look at the new vSphere 5 feature Swap to Host Cache, where vSphere 5 reclaims memory by storing the swapped out pages in the host cache on a solid-state drive. Naturally, this is a lot faster than swapping to non-SSD storage, but you will still see a performance hit when this happens.</description>

      <description>Mike Laverick has started something of a petition to bring back the VMTN Subscription option, and I could not agree more!
The VMTN Subscription was a way for interested parties to pay for a years subscription to VMware products, akin to the Microsoft Technet subscription program. It&amp;rsquo;s not intended for production use, but as a means to get hold of products for lab work, testing and development.
I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why VMware pulled the plug on that option back in 2007, but I do understand why it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring it back to life.</description>

      <description>Juan Manuel Rey&amp;rsquo;s post Monitor ESX 4.x to ESXi 5.0 migration process show how you can watch the progress of an ESX 4 to ESXi 5 upgrade procedure, by looking at the live logs.
While this is very useful, and in many cases a real learning experience, it got me thinking that these logs should be available remotely as well. Since ESXi supports, and actively encourages, the use of an external Syslog service for log file safekeeping and monitoring, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the installation logs for ESXi also be logged externally if configured?</description>

      <description>In the new VMware Workstation 8 release, VMware has added a rudimentary network simulation setting where you can tweak bandwidth and packet loss for a given network card. Very useful when testing applications and servers and want to know how they react to network issues, or if you want to simulate a WAN link. I know this was available in Workstation 7 as well, but it used to be a team feature.</description>

      <description>Installing Microsoft Windows 8 in a VMware Workstation 8 VM turned out to be a real piece of cake.
Follow the screenshots for the procedure I used, but basically all I did was to create a new VM with the pre-configured &amp;laquo;Windows 8 Server&amp;raquo; preset and inserted the downloaded ISO file.
Note: Windows 8 Server has been removed as a preset option in the final release of VMware Workstation 8, my screenshots are from the beta version.</description>

Currently the site has 8 videos available, covering content from disaster recovery to backup integrity tools.
Even if it is run by Veeam, it does not focus on Veeam specific products or services, but rather on the general ideas behind a successful backup and disaster recovery of both VMware and Hyper-V based environments.</description>

      <description>The last couple of days I&amp;rsquo;ve been in training class, taking the 6451B Planning, Deploying and Managing Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007 course.
One of the first things that got mentioned, was that for larger deployments you should not run System Center Configuration Manager virtually. Of course, this caught my eye as I&amp;rsquo;m a proponent for the virtualize first &amp;laquo;movement&amp;raquo;.
It runs out that the reason for this is that Configuration Manager is somewhat poorly designed, as just about everything it receives from the clients in the network is placed in text based log files (inbox folder) before being processed and pumped into the back-end SQL DB.</description>

      <description>Not that WSUS is expensive, after all it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;laquo;free&amp;raquo; addon to the server you&amp;rsquo;re already running if you need it. Of course, running your own Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) infrastructure is preferable in just about every scenario except for some edge cases where bandwidth or latency issues might prevent you from syncing the updates from a central repository. Sadly, these edge cases enter the fray from time to time and I recently found myself in the middle of such a scenario.</description>

      <description>The up and coming release of VMware vSphere 5 comes with an upgraded versjon of the VMware vStorage VMFS volume file system. One of the problems with VMFS-3 an earlier is that the block size you define when you format the datastore, determines the maximum size of the VMDK files stored on it. This means that when planning your datastore infrastructure you must have an idea on how large your VMDK files will potentially be during the lifecycle of the datastore.</description>

John lives and breathes his role, as Senior Social Media Strategist at VMware, and I have to say that one of the most brilliant moves VMware has done is to employ John in his current role. Lots of other corporation employ marketing people in their social media roles, VMware went the other way and put the very technically savvy Dr.</description>

I was very excited with many of the features such as Storage Profiling, Storage DRS, VMFS 5 release, and they have blown the top off of the resource limits on VMs to create Monster VMs - just to mention a few. However, one topic I notice causing quite a stir is the new licensing that seemed to be very briefly mentioned at the end of the webinar.</description>

      <description>Automating ESXi installs was made much easier after the release of vSphere 4.1 where the Scripted Install feature was added, and by using VMware Auto Deploy from VMware Labs. VMware Auto Deploy requires that you have vCenter and Host Profiles in your environment, and that again requires that you have Enterprise Plus licenses in your environment.
It is, however, possible to deploy ESXi in an automated fashion completely without vCenter and Host Profiles!</description>

Sometimes my career in this sector brings me into working with stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with before because virtualization encompasses so much. As I continue to work with other teams I learn more and more about what they do everyday. I usually find myself involved in every performance troubleshooting session and every new project these days.</description>

      <description>Now there is a catchy title if I ever saw one. Only &amp;laquo;problem&amp;raquo; is that it&amp;rsquo;s a whitepaper that I have written for Veeam. In reality this is the first published article I have ever written, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish on my own. I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it, yet strangely nervous about how it will be received by the people who download it. If you happen to do so, make sure to let me know how you found it, all comments and criticism will be most appreciated.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, vCenter Integration Mantra, I made the point that vSphere vAdmins wants the 3rd party modules to integrate into the vCenter client and show their delicious addon-value there, and not in their own management interface. Give the vAdmins the info they need, where they do most, if not all their work. Open up the admin client and let us get all that juicy and fruity information we need.</description>

      <description>During Tech Field Day #6 in Boston one particular general feature request has become increasingly prominent;
Can we have it inside the vCenter client?
In short, what we want is for all those great third party vendors like VKernel, Solarwinds and others to be able to put their feature addons directly into the vCenter client. Currently most third party apps &amp;laquo;integrate&amp;raquo; by offering a new tab where you can access it, but I would love to see that being expanded even further.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I arrived at Logan International for Tech Field Day #6 in the greater Boston area. Christopher Wells had already arrived earlier in the day, and I was lucky enough to be picked up by Stephen Foskett at the airport and chauffeured to the Sheraton Framingham Hotel and Conference center.
The travel itself was pretty uneventful, the only trouble I had was that when I landed at Schipol for transfer to the US flight, my boarding pass was nowhere to be found, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I even received it when I checked in at Bergen Airport Flesland.</description>

      <description>vSoup Episode #10 is finally released, this time with Stuart Radnidge (blog) as our guest. This episode is a bit unusual, as we didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a set agenda before starting the recording, so we jump around all of the place covering a pretty wide area of topics. Be sure to check it out!
Tech Field Day #6 is approaching really fast, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s only a week away now! I will leave for Boston on Tuesday, June 7, for what looks to be a very, very busy but fun couple of days.</description>

      <description>A while ago I got a surprising email, stating the following:
You could consider this a sincere compliment from the Gestalt IT community as your name was suggested and we think you are the kind of person we all would love to have as part of our community. This means you&#39;re independent-minded, technology-focused, community-oriented, and a thought leader in the area of IT infrastructure.  Of course, this is pretty much hogwash, but nevertheless I&amp;rsquo;m extremely honored to be invited as a delegate for Tech Field Day #6 in Boston, Mass.</description>

The voting is available to anyone who has a vmworld.com account, and the voting period is from May 9th to May 18th. The voting is global, which means a vote for a session counts as a vote for both VMworld US and VMworld EMEA as 80% of the selected sessions will occur at both events.</description>

      <description>Way back in August 24 2010 I wrote a post called vCenter Update Manager to lose it’s fat. I&amp;rsquo;m still very happy that VMware has decided to drop OS patching from the product, and I still mean that can only be a good thing. In fact, that article prompted Beth Pariseau Senior News Writer for searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com to call me when researching her VMware users eye changes to Update Manager article.</description>

VMware Compliance Checker for vSphere lets you scan your ESX and ESXi hosts for compliance with the VMware vSphere hardening guidelines to make sure your hosts are properly configured. It also lets you save and print your assessment results, so you can track your compliance level over time, or use them as documentation for internal audits.</description>

As all good vAdmins know, two is better than one, and it&amp;rsquo; so much easier to build HA solutions around!

      <description>Yesterday I attended VMware Forum 2011 in Oslo (Norwegian).
The venue and location at DogA - the Norwegian Centre for Design and Architecture was very nice, but sadly I must ask VMware who the intended audience for the VMware Forum event is?
According to the invitation the audience target is:
People that will benefit from attending VMware Forum 2011 include: CIO, CFO and General Managers Infrastructure and Datacenter Managers IT Managers and Directors Security Managers Systems Administrators Desktop, SOE Managers Application Managers, Application Administrators Application Developers IT Procurement Mangers Sadly I fail to see how the VMware Forum 2011 in Oslo would be very beneficial for existing VMware customers, at least not at a technical level.</description>

Digital Ship magazine has now published an article based on what we presented at the live event. As far as I can gather, based on the feedback both at the event and afterwards, the presentation was a success and now the Digital Ship Magazine for April 2011 includes a two page article based on the entire presentation.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful that Todd wanted to do this, and thanks to some quick Apache trickery .com now redirects to .net to make sure Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t find and penalize any double content.</description>

Like other recent management utilities from VMware, vCenter Operations comes in the form of a .OVF template (like vCMA/vMA).

      <description>Like everyone else in the vUniverse, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a play with the very recently released free vSphere Client for iPad. Since everyone, and their mother, has already blogged and reviewed it I don&amp;rsquo;t see much value in me doing the same.
What I can say though, is that the first impression is pretty great. It looks good, works well and might be one of the apps that finally gives me an actual use case for the iPad.</description>

      <description>I recently posted Using vMA as a local vSphere Patch Repository, where I outlined how you can use your vMA instances as local file repositories for updates.
This post is a continuation of that concept, but this time I&amp;rsquo;ll take it a step further and utilize rsync to make sure my vMA instances all contain the same set of patches. Rsync is great for this, as it handles fast incremental file transfers, which is a real time and bandwidth saver in my particular scenario.</description>

      <description>I like using http as the transport protocol when patching my vSphere hosts. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and in most cases immediately available over most networks. Since I want to use http as the transport, we need to make vMA work as a http server.
Starting Apache inside vMA Luckily, the Apache http daemon is installed, by default, in vMA and to utilize it all you have to do is to start it!</description>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/installing-vsphere-management-assistant-vma/</guid>
      <description>The vMA is a Virtual Appliance that you can download from VMware. It&amp;rsquo;s primary function is to enable command line based management of your ESX/ESXi systems.
Basically this is a pre-packaged virtual machine that includes vCLI and the vSphere SDK for Perl, which means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to build your own management VM or install these tools locally on a management station.
vMA is in many regards seen as a replacement for the ESX Service Console which no longer is present in ESXi.</description>

The fact of the matter is that in many cases Bob is right, virtualization admins ends up being blamed for everything.
No matter who’s fault it actually is, though, I’m the one-stop shop now for blame.</description>

      <description>Remote Desktop Connection Manager is a great tool from Microsoft which enables you to keep track of all your RDP sessions and targets in a nice GUI. One of the things it&amp;rsquo;s lacking though, is some sort of Active Directory connection that allows you to import all your server objects directly, and not manually add/remove the serves as your infrastructure changes over time.
In an attempt to bridge that gap, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a very small PowerShell script that queries your Active Directory for server objects and dumps their names into a text file that you can import into RDCMan.</description>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/windows/powershell-scripting-best-practices-analyzer-remotely/</guid>
      <description>Jan Egil Ring over at blog.powershell.no has created a great PowerShell script that lets you run the Microsoft Best Practices Analyzer on remote Windows Server 2008 R2 machines.
In short, Invoke-BPAModeling.ps1 queries your Active Directory for any machines that run Windows Server 2008 R2, runs BPA on them (if Windows PowerShell Remoting is enabled) and emails you the report.
Great tool that should be in every Windows Server admins tool-belt, and probably also set as a scheduled job to make sure you stay up to date on your servers status.</description>

      <description>Watchguard has recently retired their X series of firewalls and replaced them with their new lineup of XTM boxes.
I took this opportunity to replace my X series firewalls with some from the new lineup, and found a neat way to migrate your existing configuration from old to new in a few very easy steps.

Note: _Normally I would not recommend migrating your configuration in this manner. In my mind you should always rebuild rules when replacing your firewall, as it is the perfect time to review and do some QA.</description>

The recordings that is, not the &amp;laquo;in your in-laws living room&amp;raquo; thing, that was a one-off for sure.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say here is that yours truly, Ed Czerwin and Chris Dearden has decided that we want to be rock-stars and start our own little virtualization related podcast.</description>

      <description>Is 2010 over already? I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true that time flies when your having fun! 2010 has been a great year for me, both personally and professionally. I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you to death with personal issues, but as far as professionally goes you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to bare with me.
2010 was the year I really feel that I got a lot of good work done, and some of that are really significant changes for my organization which is in a way better state IT wise now than in 2009.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, Using the WANem WAN Emulator Virtual Appliance, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about how I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully used WANem to emulate different WAN scenarios.
Since I work for a shipping company, the ability to emulate VSAT conditions are especially useful for testing and proof-of-concept scenarios.
You can use WANem a couple of different ways but my setup is pretty simple but does the job perfectly.
Downloading WANem I have chose to use the WANem Virtual Appliance running in a virtual machine hosted by VMware Workstation.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Maish Saidel-Keesing, vExpert 2010 and blogger over at Technodrone I have been made aware that VMware has used one of my posts here on vNinja in their internal presentation material.
The material in question is vSphere 4.1 to 4.0 differences (page 44 and 45 in vSphere 4.1 Deep Dive - Part 1 - v6.pptx), where my post about Using USB Pass-through in vSphere 4.1 is quoted and my screenshots used.</description>

      <description>When Rich Brambley posted &amp;laquo;A Pirate Invented Server Virtualization&amp;raquo; today, it reminded me of a little story from my own production environment.
This story is a couple of years old, but sadly it&amp;rsquo;s still valid. A very specialized application that we run, requires a SQL Server Express instance, a proxy/licensing server and client installation with license files to work. This application isn&amp;rsquo;t very advanced, nor very resource intensive so by nature it&amp;rsquo;s prime for running in a virtualized environment.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, while I was at VMworld Europe I got the following tweet from Asbjørn A. Mikkelsen (@neslekkim) (translated from norwegian):
@h0bbel Do you know if I can script something against vCenter to duplicate (or create from template) VMs, and also start/stop them? My immediate response, was of course to suggest using PowerCLI. Asbjørn, who works as a full time developer, jumped at PowerCLI immediately and within a very short time frame came up with a PowerCLI script for the task at hand.</description>

      <description>Now that the VMworld events are over for 2010, I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to digest a lot of the impressions I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the past few days.
However, I do have a couple of suggestions I would like to voice:
 Add contact information to the attendee badge!
  Just like David Owen (@vMackem) suggested, adding Twitter ID and blog link to the attendee badge would make it easier to keep track of everyone you meet up with.</description>

      <description>I’m back home again, after spending the better part of this week in Copenhagen, attending VMworld Europe 2010.
Let me just say, straight off the bat, that attending VMworld is probably the best idea I’ve had in years. In reality, that’s not saying much, but the value of attending is immense.
The way VMworld is organized, with lots of simultaneous sessions, labs and other activities is both a challenge and a blessing.</description>

      <description>Undoubtedly one of the most popular &amp;laquo;features&amp;raquo; of VMworld 2010, both in the US and in EU, are the labs. These hands-on exercises in configuring and using various VMware products lets you play around without the need for lab equipment or licenses installed locally.  What if VMware extended this to not only run during the VMworld conferences?
Let us get our hands dirty all year round! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to have a full lab setup in the office, and if we could book time in the VMware Cloud Lane to play around with VMware vCloud™, VMware vCenter™ Site Recovery Manager or even VMware ThinApp™ that would be great!</description>

      <description>[VMworld Europe 2010 is close. Very close. In fact, lots of people are already in place in Copenhagen, personally I don’t get until tomorrow evening (the 11th).
Since I get in pretty late, I really hope I’ll be able to get to my hotel quickly, and then find Custom House for the Tweetup/VMUG Party.
Remember I have a little contest going, where you can win a copy of Trainsignal VMware vSphere Pro Series Training Vol.</description>

      <description>Sometimes leaving the defaults in place might just come back and bite you, hard.
That might also be the case with your vCenter 4.1 database, as I experienced back in July.
All of a sudden my vCenter Server stopped working. The symptoms where pretty obvious, my client couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to the vCenter server. Naturally I connected to the server, and noticed that the VMware VirtualCenter Server services had indeed stopped. No wonder the client couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to it.</description>

      <description>Today I finally got word that I will indeed be going to VMworld Europe 2010 in Copenhagen!
I&amp;rsquo;ve done the registration process, so all that remains is to book the flight and hotel and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to go.
To celebrate this, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to announce a little contest;
Where is Christian aka h0bbel? The first person to find me, as in the physical me, in the Bella Center during VMworld Europe 2010, (I&amp;rsquo;ll be there Tuesday - Thursday) will receive a free copy of the Trainsignal VMware vSphere Pro Series Training Vol.</description>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/vmware-vsphere-hypervisor-licensing-and-cost/</guid>
      <description>We all know, and love, the fact that vSphere Hypervisor is free of charge. The free version doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with all the bells and whistles of the fully licensed product, but it&amp;rsquo;s still very usable in many scenarios.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating the possibilities of running vSphere Hypervisor on a number of floating branch offices, also known as vessels.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going into details about the proposed setup, and how we intend to roll it and so on, but one of the things I really wanted to get out of this was to have all my off-site vSphere Hypervisor installs appear in my vCenter Client.</description>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/p2v-a-domain-controller-why-would-you/</guid>
      <description>Some topics seem to pop up at random intervals, one of them being virtualizing Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller servers. The question is often either &amp;laquo;Should I virtualize my Domain Controllers, and if so should I virtualize all of them?&amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo;Should I do a P2V (Physical 2 Virtual) conversion of my existing Domain Controllers, or create new ones?&amp;laquo;
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about the second question. While there is a lot to be said about the first one as well, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for future post.</description>

      <description>In fresh blog post, called &amp;laquo;Resource pools and simultaneous vMotions&amp;raquo; by Frank Denneman prompted a quick Twitter discussion regarding the vCenter client (and perhaps even vCenter itself). A simple
Why are there no folders under Host and Clusters view ? from Maish Saidel-Keesing got the ball rolling.
Could it be that the design of the client itself helps perpetuate the myth the resource pools is an organizational unit, one that should be used as a way of grouping VMs?</description>

      <description>When HP announced their new ProLiant MicroServer, I really hoped that it would be the perfect answer to a specific use case I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at lately.
Basically, what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for is a small chassis, low noise branch office server that would be used to host a single virtual machine, offering Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) and Distributed File System (DFS) file-shares.
Initially it looked to fit the bill perfectly:</description>

      <description>During preparation and preliminary information gathering for a new internal project, I had a need to emulate various networking conditions and scenarios. More specifically I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the possibility of running the vCenter Client over high latency satellite links, with varying bandwidth availability and even packet loss scenarios.
Obviously the best way of testing this, in a controlled environment, is to use some kind of WAN emulator that lets you control the various networking characteristics.</description>

In his article, Dwayne talks about vCenter Update Manager 4.1, and the fact that it seems to be the last version of the tools that will allow you to patch your Windows and Linux guests:
 VMware vCenter Update Manager Features. vCenter Update Manager 4.1 and its subesquent update releases are the last releases to support scanning and remediation of patches for Windows and Linux guest operating systems and applications running inside a virtual machine.</description>

      <description>VMware has published a new whitepaper called VMware vCenter Server Performance and Best Practices.
This is a must read if you manage a vCenter 4.1 installation, or are currently planning your upgrade.
The whitepaper highlights the performance improvements in the latest version, sizing guidelines, best practices and some really good real world information from several case studies. One simple, but probably often overlooked tip, is that the amount of vCenter Clients connected to your vCenter Server has an impact on it&amp;rsquo;s performance.</description>

      <description>Over at PlanetVM Wil van Antwerpen posted The Future of VMware Server back in May 2010. Wil makes the argument that it seems like VMware is indeed abandoning VMware Server as a product, leaving us with VMware Workstation and VMware Player as the two Windows installable virtualization solutions from the company.
This has caused some reactions, including my own comment, where I question the smartness of abandoning what might just be one of the best virtualization &amp;laquo;gateway drugs&amp;raquo; VMware has to offer.</description>

      <description>Finally USB pass-through is possible on ESX hosts with the new vSphere 4.1 release! This feature ha been available in VMware Workstation/Fusion and Player for quite a while. The freshly added feature in vSphere 4.1 even works if you vMotion the guest from one host to another, which is in itself pretty amazing functionality!
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to setup and use the new USB pass-through feature in vSphere 4.</description>

      <description>If you run your vCenter on SQL Server Express 2005, you are missing the ability to set up scheduled backup jobs with SQL Maintenance Plans, a feature available in the full version of SQL Server.
This might not be a problem if your backup software has SQL Server agents that you use to backup your vCenter databaser, but in smaller environments or even in your lab, you might not have that kind of backup scheme available to you, so what do you do?</description>

      <guid>https://vninja.net/virtualization/migrating-your-vcenter-from-32bit-to-64bit/</guid>
      <description>As you may or may not know, the new vCenter 4.1 requires that the host it runs on is 64 bit. As 4.0 and previous versions weren&amp;rsquo;t supported on 64 bit at all, this probably means that when you upgrade you will need to move your existing database to a new host.
There are several ways of doing the migration, but one way is to backup your existing database, and restore it on a new host and point the new vCenter 4.</description>

This new site will be dedicated to all things virtualization, PowerShell, Windows Server management and possibly even some Citrix products thrown in here and there. I might even go on about APP-V, but that remains to be seen.</description>
