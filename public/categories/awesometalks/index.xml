      <description>This is the third talk I&amp;rsquo;ve found worthy of publishing in the Awesome Talks series. Enjoy Simon Wardley&amp;rsquo;s Researcher, Leading Edge Forum, keynote from KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2018 called &amp;ldquo;Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones&amp;rdquo;.
Simon&amp;rsquo;s presentation technique, flair and master of language is flat out impressive — and fun!

      <description>This is the second recorded talk published in the Awesome Talks series. This time it&amp;rsquo;s Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rdquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not what you read, it&amp;rsquo;s what you ignore&amp;rdquo; talk from Dev Day in Kraków way back in 2012.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a technical talk, it&amp;rsquo;s originally geared towards developers but Scott&amp;rsquo;s message should resonate with everyone in the tech field. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s about how you can deal with large amounts of information. Lot&amp;rsquo;s of great takeaways here!</description>

      <description>This is the first post, in what hopefully will turn into a series of posts, highlighting awesome talks that are freely available. There is a lot of great content out there, both inspirational and funny, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to publish my favorites when I find them.
So here is the first one!
John Nicholson shared this awesome talk by Corey Quinn from LISA17, which should be mandatory for anyone attending conferences, or talks in general.</description>
