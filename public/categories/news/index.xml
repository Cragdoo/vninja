Before you start on this rather long post, have a go at part #1:
tl;dr This is a long read. To get to the juicy part on how Intel potentially shipped pre-release microcode to partners, skip to section 3. The short, short version is that the official Intel microcode update contains newer microcode for Skylake-SP and Kaby Lake/Coffe Lake than what currently is shipping from VMware/HPE/DellEMC etc.</description>

Disclaimer: This is a report based on current development as of 7. January, the situation is changing by the hour so read this opinion piece with that in hindsight.
Unless you have been living under a rock for the last week you will know by now that there is a universal design flaw in most modern microprocessors, leaving them vulnerable to a serious information disclosure problem that requires updates to all operating systems and processors.</description>

      <description>My good friends, and fellow VMUGgers, in Denmark is once again arranging the largest VMUG event in the Nordics in January 2018.
The Nordic VMUG Conference promises to be just as awesome as previous versions, just have a look at this speaker list:
 Opening Keynote:** Kit Colbert**
 Breakout sessions: **Ole Agesen, Duncan Epping, Myles Gray, Frank Denneman, Niels Hagoort, Grant Orchard and Joerg Lew**
 Closing Keynote:** Ken Westin**</description>

      <description>I have given the site a small facelift, replacing the old theme with a new and cleaner version. For some reason, I get this &amp;ldquo;theme itch&amp;rdquo; a couple of times a year, but usually I manage to let it pass without doing many changes.
This time it stuck with me though, and ended up with replacing the old theme with a new one. In fact, the old theme had been active for close to two years now, so it was time to shake things up a bit any way.</description>

      <description>The 2016 Nordic VMUG UserCon in Copenhagen, Denmark, is just 11 days away, and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t registered already now is the time to do so. As usual the speaker lineup for the event is awesome, with a lot of the usual suspects like Duncan Epping (VMware), Cormac Hogan (VMware), Lee Dilworth (VMware), and Frank Denneman (VMware), but VMware is also showing it&amp;rsquo;s commitment to VMUG by sending some non-europeans as well, like Grant Orchard and_ Mike Foley_.</description>

      <description>Now that the seasons have changed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at 2017 and start planning the year. First up, when is VMworld 2017, and perhaps most importantly where? There has been a lot of speculation about this, and the perhaps strongest rumour was that it was moving to Berlin.
The details for the US has already been posted on vmworld.com, but for Europe all it says is &amp;ldquo;Fall&amp;rdquo;.
According to Duncan, which usually is in the know, VMworld Europe 2017 will once again be in Barcelona, but in September instead of October.</description>

      <description>After yesterdays announcement of VMware Cloud™ on AWS everyone and their distant relatives have published their opinion pieces on the relevance of the deal, and what who got the short end of the stick in this deal. I guess this is my attempt, or me too post if you will.
First off, the best source for actual facts and not conjecture, besides the press releases and actual announcement, is Frank Denneman&amp;rsquo;s VMware Cloud™ on AWS – A Closer Look post (and by the way, it just_ feels right_ that Frank is back at VMware).</description>

      <description>As we all know by now, PernixData was gobbled up by Nutanix a while back, and since then there has been a nothing but silence on the future of the FVP and Architect products. Now it seems it&amp;rsquo;s over. The acquisition trigged a bunch of PernixData employees moving elsewhere, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the products time to move on as well.
From what I&amp;rsquo;m hearing, End of Sale and End of Life for both products are due to be announced soon.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I decided to go full-on mad scientist in documenting my new home lab / network setup, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even created a GitHub repository for it.
The idea is to create a framework for developing this kind of documentation, heavily influenced by the VCDX methodology and framework. Over time, Conceptual, Logical and Physical designs will be added, as well as configuration settings and operational procedures. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll also contain some useful diagrams.</description>

      <description>While I was away on a two week holiday on the Croatia&amp;rsquo;s sunny Makarska Rivijera, Eric Siebert announced the result of his annual Top vBlog, and much to my surprise vNinja did quite the jump from last years 46th spot to this years 27th! Honestly, I thought the site would drop out of the the top 50 list this year, but once again I&amp;rsquo;m proven to be mistaken. Some times being wrong is just great!</description>

      <description>A friend of Mr. Jase McCarty is teaching a class in programming control systems, and is in need of a few Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.
Sadly the school can&amp;rsquo;t afford buying them outright, so if you have one laying around, that you are not using, get in touch with Jase and he&amp;rsquo;ll set you up with the details on how you can contribute! If you want to do even better, and buy some RPi&amp;rsquo;s outright and donate them to the project, check out this Amazon Wishlist!</description>

      <description>Way back in late 2014 I volunteered to do technical review for a book called **IT Architect: Foundation in the Art of Infrastructure Design: A Practical Guide for IT Architects. Due to a lot of unforeseen events, the book has been delayed quite a bit, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally available as hardcopy, paperback and eBook! The book is written by J**ohn Yani Arrasjid, VCDX-001, Mark Gabryjelski, VCDX-023, Chris McCain, VCDX-079 and as the title states it really does lay out the foundation of how to approach infrastructure design in a modern virtualised data center.</description>

      <description>PernixData, and Frank Denneman, has released vSphere Design Pocketbook v3. As the title reads, this is the third time PernixData releases one of these books, and I&amp;rsquo;m honored to be selected amongst the contributors for the second time, this time with a chapter called &amp;ldquo;VCSA vs Windows vCenter - Which One Do I Choose, and Why?&amp;ldquo;
Go grab your electronic copy now, and be sure to bug your local PernixData representative for a hard-copy later.</description>

      <description>I think Seth Godin might have been onto something with &amp;ldquo;Make something happen&amp;rdquo;, so I did.
Today was my last day at EVRY. Some might already have been aware of this, mostly because of Hoff-Job-Announcement-as-a-Service, but also because of my own tweet as I left the EVRY offices in Bergen as an employee for the last time:
https://twitter.com/h0bbel/status/715526670254473217
The decision to leave EVRY was not an easy one, but it was time to try something else.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I saw this tweet from Stephen Foskett: https://twitter.com/sfoskett/status/672071591245783042
Which spurred a discussion back and forth, with a few rather interesting statements from yourdailytech.com, like this one
https://twitter.com/yourdailytechus/status/672083101682679808
The problem is that they take original content from other sites, and republish it on their own. At first glance, you&amp;rsquo;ll see Angelica as the author, even if they claim that that&amp;rsquo;s not the intention. It just happens to be that user account that published the reproduced content, like this one 5 Key Aspects for Safe Virtualization &amp;ndash; The original author is mentioned in the article itself, in this case Camilo Gutierrez Amaya published on www.</description>

      <description>As a few of you have noticed, I recently changed my title on LinkedIn from Chief Consultant to Cloud Architect in the newly formed EVRY Cloud Consulting division, but what does that mean and perhaps more importantly, why?
The closest description I have found to describe what my new role is this:
 Leads in the development of the technical solution or offering, in translating the business needs into technical requirements.</description>

The new pricing is very attractive, especially since you no longer need to buy access on a course by course basis.
The courses are delivered in your browser, but Trainsignal also offers an offline player in case you need access when traveling or otherwise offline.</description>

      <description>VMware Offers vCloud “Test-Drive” with New Evaluation Service.
This announcement doesn´t seem to be &amp;ldquo;Project Zephyr&amp;rdquo; which, if the rumors are true, is VMware´s own fully fledged IaaS service.
This Public vCloud “Test-Drive” service, which VMware themselves describe as “white-label” from a vCloud service provider, seems like a way for VMware to provide cheap test-drive access, to vCloud through their existing service providers.
Where the rumored &amp;ldquo;Project Zephyr&amp;rdquo; might be seen as a competing service, Public vCloud looks to be engineered to drive long term customers to the existing ecosystem of providers.</description>

Scott Sauer has announced the availability of &amp;ldquo;VMware Virtual Customer Labs” (vCL) where he walks us through the setup and delivery of the new vCL offering.
At the moment it´s only available to &amp;ldquo;selected customers&amp;rdquo;, supported by a VMware pre-sales engineer, and the number of labs are limited. It´s still a work in progress, and I´m sure great things will come out of this!</description>

      <description>Yes, this is YAEotYP, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve already read tons of them I apologize.
2011 - My personal view 2011 has been a steamroller of a year.The vSoup Virtualization Podcast got aired the first time, and we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded and published 19 full episodes in the inaugural year. I was awarded the vExpert title for the first time, and even got invited to Tech Field Day #6 in Boston.
In addition to this, I wrote a white paper for Veeam, was included in the Server Virtualization Advisory Board, joined Rick Vanover for a Veeam Community Podcast, and appeared in two video interviews.</description>

Seatrans has been a fantastic employer, and without the backing and support I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years I would not be in a position where this change would be possible.</description>

      <title>vSphere 5 and new licensing - Good or bad?</title>

      <description>As many of you did I watched todays Cloud Infrastructure Forum and the release of vSphere 5 today. I was very excited with many of the features such as Storage Profiling, Storage DRS, VMFS 5 release, and they have blown the top off of the resource limits on VMs to create Monster VMs - just to mention a few. However, one topic I notice causing quite a stir is the new licensing that seemed to be very briefly mentioned at the end of the webinar.</description>

      <description>Now there is a catchy title if I ever saw one. Only &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; is that it&amp;rsquo;s a whitepaper that I have written for Veeam. In reality this is the first published article I have ever written, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish on my own. I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it, yet strangely nervous about how it will be received by the people who download it. If you happen to do so, make sure to let me know how you found it, all comments and criticism will be most appreciated.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, vCenter Integration Mantra, I made the point that vSphere vAdmins wants the 3rd party modules to integrate into the vCenter client and show their delicious addon-value there, and not in their own management interface. Give the vAdmins the info they need, where they do most, if not all their work. Open up the admin client and let us get all that juicy and fruity information we need.</description>

      <description>During Tech Field Day #6 in Boston one particular general feature request has become increasingly prominent;
Can we have it inside the vCenter client?
In short, what we want is for all those great third party vendors like VKernel, Solarwinds and others to be able to put their feature addons directly into the vCenter client. Currently most third party apps &amp;ldquo;integrate&amp;rdquo; by offering a new tab where you can access it, but I would love to see that being expanded even further.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I arrived at Logan International for Tech Field Day #6 in the greater Boston area. Christopher Wells had already arrived earlier in the day, and I was lucky enough to be picked up by Stephen Foskett at the airport and chauffeured to the Sheraton Framingham Hotel and Conference center.
The travel itself was pretty uneventful, the only trouble I had was that when I landed at Schipol for transfer to the US flight, my boarding pass was nowhere to be found, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I even received it when I checked in at Bergen Airport Flesland.</description>

      <description>vSoup Episode #10 is finally released, this time with Stuart Radnidge (blog) as our guest. This episode is a bit unusual, as we didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a set agenda before starting the recording, so we jump around all of the place covering a pretty wide area of topics. Be sure to check it out!
Tech Field Day #6 is approaching really fast, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s only a week away now! I will leave for Boston on Tuesday, June 7, for what looks to be a very, very busy but fun couple of days.</description>

      <description>A while ago I got a surprising email, stating the following:
You could consider this a sincere compliment from the Gestalt IT community as your name was suggested and we think you are the kind of person we all would love to have as part of our community. This means you&#39;re independent-minded, technology-focused, community-oriented, and a thought leader in the area of IT infrastructure.  Of course, this is pretty much hogwash, but nevertheless I&amp;rsquo;m extremely honored to be invited as a delegate for Tech Field Day #6 in Boston, Mass.</description>

      <description>VMware has opened the public voting for the VMworld 2011 sessions. Personally I haven&amp;rsquo;t submitted anything, but I do see a lot of familiar names in the voting application.
The voting is available to anyone who has a vmworld.com account, and the voting period is from May 9th to May 18th. The voting is global, which means a vote for a session counts as a vote for both VMworld US and VMworld EMEA as 80% of the selected sessions will occur at both events.</description>

      <description>The first version of the new VMware Compliance Checker for vSphere tool is now available for download.
VMware Compliance Checker for vSphere lets you scan your ESX and ESXi hosts for compliance with the VMware vSphere hardening guidelines to make sure your hosts are properly configured. It also lets you save and print your assessment results, so you can track your compliance level over time, or use them as documentation for internal audits.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that my fellow vSoup Podcast co-host Ed Czerwin is on board as blogger here on vNinja.net! This means that from now on you won&amp;rsquo;t just have to put up with the content of one virtualization admin, but two!
As all good vAdmins know, two is better than one, and it&amp;rsquo; so much easier to build HA solutions around!
Welcome aboard Ed, glad to have you on!</description>

      <description>Yesterday I attended VMware Forum 2011 in Oslo (Norwegian).
The venue and location at DogA - the Norwegian Centre for Design and Architecture was very nice, but sadly I must ask VMware who the intended audience for the VMware Forum event is?
According to the invitation the audience target is:
People that will benefit from attending VMware Forum 2011 include: CIO, CFO and General Managers Infrastructure and Datacenter Managers IT Managers and Directors Security Managers Systems Administrators Desktop, SOE Managers Application Managers, Application Administrators Application Developers IT Procurement Mangers Sadly I fail to see how the VMware Forum 2011 in Oslo would be very beneficial for existing VMware customers, at least not at a technical level.</description>

      <description>Back in February 2011 I was invited, along with my IT Manager, to do a presentation at Digital Ship Scandinavia 2011.
Digital Ship magazine has now published an article based on what we presented at the live event. As far as I can gather, based on the feedback both at the event and afterwards, the presentation was a success and now the Digital Ship Magazine for April 2011 includes a two page article based on the entire presentation.</description>

In related news, VMware has created a Virtualization Podcast directory over on the VMware Communities portal. Way to go John, hopefully the other podcasts will follow suite so we can have one common directory for all of us!</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful that Todd wanted to do this, and thanks to some quick Apache trickery .com now redirects to .net to make sure Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t find and penalize any double content.</description>

      <description>The fourth edition (Big Fat Pipes with Bob) of the vSoup podcast is now available. This time we had the honor of having Bob Plankers as a guest. Bob runs The Lone Sysadmin, where his recent post &amp;ldquo;Blame&amp;rdquo; really resonated well with me personally.
The fact of the matter is that in many cases Bob is right, virtualization admins ends up being blamed for everything.
No matter who’s fault it actually is, though, I’m the one-stop shop now for blame.</description>

      <description>In a previous article, HP ProLiant MicroServer – Not Quite There Yet?, I questioned whether the HP Proliant MicroServer could have a place in a corporate environment.
I finally got my hands on one, and for my specific use case it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much perfect! Sure, I would love to have some vSphere supported RAID controller and a beefier CPU but in my use case the MicroServer delivers just what we need for some of our small branch offices.</description>

And to top it of; it&amp;rsquo;s all being recorded. And to make matters even worse, we decided to try and make it a regular thing. The recordings that is, not the &amp;ldquo;in your in-laws living room&amp;rdquo; thing, that was a one-off for sure.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say here is that yours truly, Ed Czerwin and Chris Dearden has decided that we want to be rock-stars and start our own little virtualization related podcast.</description>

I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you to death with personal issues, but as far as professionally goes you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to bare with me.
2010 was the year I really feel that I got a lot of good work done, and some of that are really significant changes for my organization which is in a way better state IT wise now than in 2009.</description>

The material in question is vSphere 4.1 to 4.0 differences (page 44 and 45 in vSphere 4.1 Deep Dive - Part 1 - v6.pptx), where my post about Using USB Pass-through in vSphere 4.1 is quoted and my screenshots used.</description>

      <description>When HP announced their new ProLiant MicroServer, I really hoped that it would be the perfect answer to a specific use case I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at lately.
Basically, what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for is a small chassis, low noise branch office server that would be used to host a single virtual machine, offering Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) and Distributed File System (DFS) file-shares.
Initially it looked to fit the bill perfectly:</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new playground. I used to post quite a lot over at my old site, h0bbel.p0ggel.org but given it&amp;rsquo;s weird domain name and it&amp;rsquo;s long history I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start fresh.
This new site will be dedicated to all things virtualization, PowerShell, Windows Server management and possibly even some Citrix products thrown in here and there. I might even go on about APP-V, but that remains to be seen.</description>
