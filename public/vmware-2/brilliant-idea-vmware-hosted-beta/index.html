<p>_Due to the very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement">NDA</a> nature of the beta programs, I can´t really go into details on what is currently offered, but what I can say is this: Well done VMware!_</p>

<p>The VMware Hosted Beta runs on the same engine that runs the <a href="http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vmware-hands-on-lab-online-review/">VMware Hands on Labs Online – Beta</a>, but with a little added twist. You connect to the hosted beta through a web interface, before the actual connection is handed over to a locally installed VMware Horizon View client. This works very well, and I got to play around a bit with it a bit yesterday.</p>

<p>The idea of a hosted beta like this really resonates with me, as one of the major time sinks when it comes to actively participating in betas is the physical setup of a lab environment. As I am currently without a properly powerful lab, something that will change very soon I hope, getting hosted beta access could not be more welcome.</p>

<p>This way I get to dip my toes in the beta offerings, without having to procure the required hardware. While I don´t think the hosted beta replaces the need for a dedicated physical lab, it sure does work as an excellent stop-gap in the mean time. It also means that you can jump in and out of various pieces of the beta, without having to spend a lot of time configuring an environment from scratch. In addition, this also means that you can get a working environment set up in a matter of minutes, and all you need is <del>love</del> an internet connection.</p>

<p>Of course, VMware does not want everyone to run all their beta testing in this environment, they need feedback on installation and configuration issues in &ldquo;real world&rdquo; scenarios as well as plain old feature testing in a controlled environment, but this is a very welcome addition in my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Kudos to the HoL and Beta teams at VMware, this makes my day so much easier and I am sure it will also help them in getting better feedback from us beta testers.</strong></p>
