  <p>Everyone, and probably their extended family including their mother-in-law, has heard me <a href="http://vninja.net/vmware-2/vcp-5-certification-requirement-clarification/">whine and complain</a> about the <a href="www.vmware.com/go/vcp">VCP</a> training requirements.</p>

<p>VMware has unveiled a new lab, namely <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/nee/">Project Nee</a> (Next-Generation Education Environment)</p>

<p>and this is something I´m <em>really</em> excited about.</p>

<p>Project Nee is described as this:</p>

<blockquote>VMware Project NEE is a new VMware Labs project providing a richly featured, powerful online learning and lab environment delivered from the cloud to any device, anywhere, anytime.</blockquote>

<p>There aren´t many details available at the moment, except that this seems to be exactly what I have looked for from VMware;
<strong>Online access to a virtual lab environment, where you can access training resources in a flexible manner. Self paced online training, without the need to spend days on end in a classroom.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the site specifically mentions “_VMware vSphere: Install, Configure, Manage_” training as being specifically beta tested at the moment.</p>

<p>There is no information on pricing and availability just yet, but with <a href="http://vmworld.com">VMworld Europe</a> only a week away I would not be surprised if something is to be announced in Barcelona.</p>

<p>With the VMware Hands-On Labs going public some time soon, and now Project Nee, VMware is certainly heading in the right direction as far as lab access and training is concerned.</p>
