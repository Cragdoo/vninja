  <p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/VCP5.png" alt="VCP5" />VMware has announced a Recertification Policy for it&rsquo;s VMware Certified Professional program, effective as of March 10, 2014.</p>

<p>In short, it means that you are no longer a VCP(x) for life, but need to recertify every 2 years, unless you take a VCAP exam during the same period. If you do not upgrade your certification, your VCP status is revoked. For all the details, have a look at <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=46667&amp;ui=www_cert">Recertification Policy: VMware Certified Professional</a>.</p>

<p>It also means that anyone currently holding a VCP certification, needs to recertify before March 10th 2015, regardless of when the initial VCP was obtained.  Those obtaining a VCP after March 10th, will have to recertify within two years of obtaining the initial VCP.</p>

<p>I think this is a good move, and is on par with other technical certifications like ones offered by HP, Cisco and CompTia (A+). After all, we live in an ever evolving technical market where continuous change happens and if you are not able to keep current, the certification holds no real merit.</p>

<p>This change from VMware also means that as long as you recertify your VCP exam within the two year period, there will not be a course requirement to upgrade; schedule your exam and you are ready to go. Previously you would get a grace period, after a new major release of vSphere, where you could re-certify without having to attend a new class. With this change, you have two years, and that is it.</p>

<p>In a way, this also means that VMware will have to commit to major releases, with upgraded VCP versions, more frequently than every 2 years.</p>

<p>Looking at the last two vSphere releases, this seems to indicate a change in release cycles for major versions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>vSphere 4</strong> was released  May 21st 2009.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>vSphere 5</strong> was released July 12th 2011</p></li>

<li><p><strong>vSphere 5.5</strong> was released September 22nd 2013.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, vSphere 5.5 is covered by the VCP5 (ok, there is a VCP510 and VCP550 version) certification, so if this policy was in place in 2011 when vSphere 5 was released, there would not be any upgraded VCP certification to take within the two year validity period.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><em>What if VMware had called an old VCP certification &ldquo;retired&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;expired&rdquo;, would that cause less outrage and emotion?</em></p>
