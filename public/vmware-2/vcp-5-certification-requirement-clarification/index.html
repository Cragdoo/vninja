  <p>In a recent article, <a href="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/news/2240114790/VCP-5-certification-course-deadline-looms-over-VMware-pros">VCP 5 certification course deadline looms over VMware pros</a> both vNinja.net contributors (<a href="http://vninja.net/about/christian-mohn/">Christian</a> and <a href="http://vninja.net/about/ed-czerwin/">Ed</a>) are quoted in relation to the VCP 5 certification upgrade deadline of February 29th 2012.</p>

<p>While I can´t speak for Ed, I can clarify my own comments a bit. The following is a quote from VMware, taken from the article in question:</p>

<blockquote>“That requirement is in place to maintain the integrity of the certification. If people could pass the VCP 5 without exposure to and hands-on experience with vSphere 5, it would devalue the certification,” a VMware spokesperson wrote in an email.</blockquote>

<p>While I do see why VMware has that stance, and why they try to keep the exam &ldquo;real&rdquo;, my problem is that there is no way for anyone to do the VCP certification without classroom training. I don´t mind that VMware has a training requirement, and I don´t mind that you have to pay for it. What I do have a problem with is that I´m required to sit a 5 day training class. Why not offer an online VCP-prep course that you can complete in your own pace, complete with a pre-exam test that you can use to validate your skill set? That way VMware can still require a minimum of training pre-exam, get paid for it, and students can do their training in their own pace and when they have available time for it. Seems like a win-win (bingo!) situation to me?</p>

<p>As far as I´ve heard the VCP5 exam focuses less on minimum and maximum configuration limits than the VCP4 which is a good thing, but at the same time I don´t think the <em>Install, Configure and Manage</em> course by itself is enough to pass the exam, so in essence VMware is already &ldquo;devaluing&rdquo; their own exam by requiring training that does not cover the entire curriculum.</p>

<p>The hands-on requirement is a good one, and <em>I applaud it</em>, the best way to ensure that would be to turn the VCP exam into a hands-on-lab environment where you get tasks to complete, instead of multiple choice questions.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: I have not yet tried to do the VCP 5 exam and I´m only commenting based on feedback provided by others who have.</strong></p>

<p>As far as the time available for existing VCPs to upgrade from VCP4 to VCP5, I also believe the timeframe is too short, and to be completely honest I don´t really see why there should be a time limit at all? After all, if you have the VCP4, you pretty much know what you´re in for with regards to the VCP5. Why rush it, and have people attempt to upgrade before they are ready? Let people do this on their own, in their own schedule, I don´t see how VMware benefits from enforcing a timeframe at all. Unless the motivation is selling more training, of course.</p>
