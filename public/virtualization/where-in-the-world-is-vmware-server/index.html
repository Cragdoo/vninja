  <p><img src="/images/logos/vmware-logo.gif" alt="" />Over at <a href="http://planetvm.net/">PlanetVM</a>  <a href="http://twitter.com/wilva">Wil van Antwerpen</a> posted <a href="http://planetvm.net/blog/?p=1569">The Future of VMware Server</a> back in May 2010. Wil makes the argument that it seems like VMware is indeed abandoning VMware Server as a product, leaving us with VMware Workstation and VMware Player as the two Windows installable virtualization solutions from the company.</p>

<p>This has caused some reactions, including <a href="http://planetvm.net/blog/?p=1569&amp;cpage=1#comment-2869">my own comment</a>, where I question the smartness of abandoning what might just be one of the best virtualization &ldquo;gateway drugs&rdquo; VMware has to offer.</p>

<p>In my opinion, abandoning VMware Server would be a  bad move, but re-reading the documentation from VMware and thinking more about the consequences this might have made me realize something;</p>

<p><strong>What if VMware is working on a replacement product or management solution?</strong></p>

<p>I seriously doubt VMware would want to abandon the use case that VMware Server has, even if they do indeed abandon the VMware Server product itself. I don&rsquo;t have any inside knowledge about this, but lets say that VMware is working on a management framework for VMware Player?</p>

<p>Something that you can install, in addition to VMware Player, that lets you set auto-start parameters for VMs, let them run headless and remotely manage them? <em>Wouldn&rsquo;t that pretty much allow us to do the same with VMware Player, that we today use VMware Server for?</em></p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more it makes sense.</p>
