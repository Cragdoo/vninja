<strong>What if VMware extended this to not only run during the VMworld conferences?</strong></p>

<p>Let us get our hands dirty all year round! It&rsquo;s hard to have a full lab setup in the office, and if we could book time in the VMware Cloud Lane to play around with VMware vCloud™, VMware vCenter™ Site Recovery Manager or even VMware ThinApp™ that would be great!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure VMware can see the value in providing their customers <em>and</em> partners with hands-on labs for training purposes, as well as being a great showcase for their core &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; services as enterprise ready.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m not suggesting they give everyone and their mother lab access 24/7/365, VMware should indeed offer a way for customers and partners to book time and play around.</p>

<p><em>After all, VMware want us to buy their products and their vision for the cloud, don&rsquo;t they?</em></p>
