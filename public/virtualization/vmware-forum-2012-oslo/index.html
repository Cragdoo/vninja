<p>Just like <a href="http://vninja.net/news/vmware-forum-2011-oslo/">last year</a>, I got up really early and caught a 06:40 am flight from Bergen to Oslo to attend the <a href="http://www.vmwareforum2012.com/Oslo/">VMware Forum</a>. A couple of things have changed since the last time, one of them being the venue.</p>

<p>This time around it was held at <a href="http://www.ubc.no/">Ullevaal Business Class</a>, and the venue itself worked great for a one day conference like this, divided into three sections, two for parallel sessions and one for the exhibitor area.</p>

<p><a href="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/VMware-Forum-2012-Badge.jpg"><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/VMware-Forum-2012-Badge-150x150.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>One of the other changes from last year, is that I now work for a VMware Partner, who was also a Platinum Sponsor of the event. This was my first event working for a partner, and I even had booth duty! Talking with customers in a partner setting is quite different from being a customer yourself, so that was interesting in an of itself. Sadly this also meant that I missed most of the sessions, but I did manage to catch the keynote by Brian Gammage, VMware´s Chief Market Technologist.</p>

<p><a href="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/25ed30c48f8011e1989612313815112c_7.jpg"><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/25ed30c48f8011e1989612313815112c_7-150x150.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I even got a &ldquo;1-on-1&rdquo; session with Mr. Gammage, accompanied with a couple of my colleagues from <a href="http://www.evry.com/it-services/consulting-services-/technology-consulting1/">EVRY Consulting</a>, which was <strong>really</strong> interesting to say the least. Listening to someone <em>extremely</em> knowledgeable and visionary, in a small non-speaking setting was an eye-opener with regards to how VMware sees the future of end user computing. Sadly I can´t go into details about it, but I´m confident that VMware has a strategy in the works that might just surprise more than a few people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this &ldquo;1-on-1&rdquo; session collided with both <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/viewgeek">Joel Lindberg´s</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/leedilworth">Lee Dilworth´s</a> sessions, so I didn´t catch any of those, which in reality was the two sessions I was looking most forward to beforehand. Also, what´s up with scheduling both those sessions against each other, that sounds like a bit of bad planning from the organizing committee.</p>

<p>I did however get to meet both of them in the exhibition area, even if only ever so briefly. I also met up with both <a href="http://twitter.com/vegard_s">Vegard Sagbakken</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/zztony">Stein Willhelmsen</a> from VMware, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mikebeevor">Mike Beevor</a> from Whiptail and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Linuss72/">Linus Svensson</a> from Veeam.</p>

<p>All in all I think VMworld Forum 2012 in Oslo was a step in the right direction compared to last year, but it´s still not a very technical event and I don&rsquo;t´really think it is supposed to be. Perhaps my expectations for it last year were a bit high, and this year they might just have been a bit to low.</p>

<p>Oh, I even spotted <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/codybunch">Cody Bunch´s</a> Automating vSphere with VMware vCenter Orchestrator book in the wild!</p>
