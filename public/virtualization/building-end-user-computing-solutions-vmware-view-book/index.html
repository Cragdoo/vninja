  <p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/product_thumbnail.php_.jpeg" alt="" /><a href="http://twitter.com/Mike_Laverick/">Mike Laverick</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/VirtualisedReal">Barry Coombs</a> has released their new book, elegantly titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/mike-laverick-and-barry-coombs/building-end-user-computing-solutions-with-vmware-view/ebook/product-20309411.html">Building End-User Computing Solutions with VMware View</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Not only is this a great book, it is something that every existing <em>and</em> potential VMware View (and related technologies in the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/end-user-computing/euc-platform.html">EUC</a> area) administrator should add to their (digital) bookshelves.</p>

<p>I´ll let the authors themselves describe it:</p>

<blockquote>This book is all about VMware View 5.1 and ThinApp 4.7.2 administration - and it takes in a wide scope of complementary technologies from the likes of Teradici, BitDefender and F5 Networks. Towards the end the focus switches away from virtual desktops to look at the future of end-user computing including VMware’s ThinApp Factory and Horizon Appliction Manager.

This book is a not for profit venture. The monies raised by the sale of the book will be donated in full to the work of UNICEF. UNICEF carries out work across the globe that benefits all children regardless of their social, ethnic, religious or geographical location. It’s our sincere hope that people will use the legitimate sources for acquiring this book – and by doing so support the work of UNICEF.</blockquote>

<p>Writing the foreword for a book like this has been a secret personal goal of mine for quite some time, so when I was approached by Mike about writing it I immediately jumped on the opportunity. I´m truly honored to have a small part in this non-profit project, and I hope that in the end it will generate a sizable contribution to the great work done by <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a>.</p>
