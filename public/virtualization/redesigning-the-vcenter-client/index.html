A simple</p>

<blockquote>Why are there no folders under Host and Clusters view ?</blockquote>

<p>from <a href="http://twitter.com/maishsk/status/25056375559">Maish Saidel-Keesing</a> got the ball rolling.</p>

<p>Could it be that the design of the client itself helps perpetuate the myth the resource pools is an organizational unit, one that should be used as a way of grouping VMs? As Frank says;</p>

<blockquote>This is not (the) reason why VMware invented resource pools.</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into why this is a bad idea, both <a href="http://twitter.com/FrankDenneman">Frank</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/DuncanYB">Duncan</a> will have far more intelligent feedback to you if you are interested in discussing this.</p>

<p><strong>Now, if you could redesign the vSphere Client, based on your own experience, what would you change?</strong></p>

<p>I can see that in many cases, a lightweight vCenter Simple Mode client would do the trick. Give your VM admins the Simple Mode client, and they won&rsquo;t have to worry about resource pools, HA/DRS and other advanced features. Let them administer the VMs, like adding networking, powering on/off etc. The same applies for your storage admins. Give them a small, limited, client that only allows them to configure storage aspects.</p>

<p>I know you can do most of this with permissions etc, but I still feel a limited client could be <em>one</em> way to go.</p>

<p>In other cases, like mine, it won&rsquo;t help splitting up the client into smaller chunks. As in most SMBs, I wear a <em>lot</em> of different hats during a normal working day. I&rsquo;m the networking-/storage-/operating-systems-guy in a small shop, where there simply isn&rsquo;t room for delegating all these tasks to specialized teams or even other admins.</p>

<p><strong>Perhaps dividing the client into specialized sub-topics would help?</strong></p>

<p>A task based user experience where you can select between <strong>&ldquo;VM Operations&rdquo;</strong>, <strong>&ldquo;vSphere Operations&rdquo;</strong>, <strong>&ldquo;Storage Operations&rdquo;</strong> or <strong>&ldquo;Network Operations&rdquo;</strong> as your initial choice, and then limit what you can configure based on your initial choice would help organize the screen real estate? You could also have sub-sections like <strong>&ldquo;Monitoring VMs&rdquo;</strong>, <strong>&ldquo;Monitoring Storage&rdquo;</strong> and so on, displaying a performance overview as the initial point of entry.</p>

<p>You could still have an <strong>&ldquo;Advanced Mode&rdquo;</strong> that works the same way the vCenter Client works today, but the default would be a simplified experience that is based on the task you have at hand.</p>

<p><em>Am I completely out on a limb here, or is this semi-rant making some sense, somewhere? What would you change, and how?</em></p>
