A couple of days ago, while I was at VMworld Europe I got the following <a href="http://twitter.com/neslekkim/status/27125696800">tweet</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/neslekkim">Asbjørn A. Mikkelsen (@neslekkim)</a> (translated from norwegian):</p>

<blockquote>@h0bbel Do you know if I can script something against vCenter to duplicate (or create from template) VMs, and also start/stop them?</blockquote>

<p>My immediate response, was of course to suggest using <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/vsphere/automationtools/powercli">PowerCLI</a>. Asbjørn, who works as a full time developer, jumped at PowerCLI immediately and within a very short time frame came up with a PowerCLI script for the task at hand.</p>

<p>You can <a href="/code/VI-automation1.ps">download the script</a> and play around with it, if you want. Inline documentation is in Norwegian, and if Asbjørn had intended to redistribute the script I&rsquo;m sure he would have optimized it more than the current revision.
<!-- more -->
The point here isn&rsquo;t the implementation itself, but rather the fact that he was able to put this automation routine together very quickly, and completely without prior knowledge to PowerCLI at all.</p>

<p>I do feel bad for not pointing him to <a href="http://www.powergui.org/index.jspa">PowerGUI</a> and the <a href="http://www.powergui.org/entry.jspa?externalID=1802&amp;categoryID=290">VI Toolkit PowerPack</a> before he sat down and crafted this in Notepad though. I&rsquo;m sure he cursed me silently as soon as I pointed them out to him, as that combination makes this kind of automation so much easier.</p>
