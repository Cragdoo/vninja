  <p>Some time during the <a href="http://podcastingforcancer.org">Podcasting for Cancer</a> fundraiser period I somehow suggested that we should pair it with this years <a href="https://www.movember.com">Movember</a>.</p>

<p>Despite my wife and daughters strenuous protests, I signed up and went all in. By all in, I mean, all in. For the first time since I went to my then employers christmas party dressed as a woman, I shaved my whole face.</p>

<p>My trusty goatee, who had been pretty much constantly with me since 1997, was gone. I looked like I was 12 years old.</p>

<p>And to be honest, it went pretty much downhill from there.</p>

<p><a href="http://mobro.co/h0bbel">I would like to thank Matthew Northam, Arjan Timmerman, Duncan Epping, Eric Sloof, Marco Broeken and Julian Wood for their Movember donations in my name.</a></p>

<p>Sorry guys, but this is what you actually paid for.  It´s not pretty, but it is what it is. Remember, you have been warned.</p>

<p>I guess that if this IT and virtualization thing doesn&rsquo;t work out, I can always audition for a part in Sons of Anarchy&hellip;</p>
