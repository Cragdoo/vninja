  <p>So, the cat formerly known as vSphere.next is finally out of it&rsquo;s rather big bag, and vSphere 6.0 has been officially announced and will be available some time in Q1 (no date has been announced yet). There is <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2015/02/vsphere-6-0-vexpert-blog-articles.html">enough of posts</a> going into details on what is new and what has been announced, so I won&rsquo;t be going over that right now. If you want to hear me talk about vSphere 6.0 and related news, you can always attend <a href="http://vmug.no/pamelding-vmug-bergen-19-februar/">VMUG Norway on the 19th of february</a>.</p>

<p>I do however have some other comments to make, and perhaps some observations that might have passed below radar altitude in all the announcement hoopla.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mcowger/status/562292397875273729">https://twitter.com/mcowger/status/562292397875273729</a></p>

<p>Some read this as &ldquo;VMware is shifting to offering new features on their own cloud services first, then on premises later&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t. I believe this means a monumental shift on how VMware is handling releases and offering new features. I wouldn&rsquo;t be suprised if vSphere 6, and related products, <strong>is one of the last or even the last monolithic release they do.</strong></p>

<p>My take on this is that VMware is moving towards adopting more of a cloud culture in how in handles development. Goodbye <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall development</a> and Hello Agile development. Sure, Agile development and cloud provides checkboxes in any decent buzzword-bingo game, but if we are to believe in Cloud, DevOps and a truly Software Defined Data Center, the color of the development carpet needs to match the drapes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not about treating on-premises customers as second class citizens, it&rsquo;s about actually practicing what you preach. The next big thing might just start as a fling and end up as a feature, and you might not have to wait until v7.4 to get it.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Cloud first&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;vCloud Air first&rdquo;, it just means that you and me can get our hands on the naughty bits earlier.</strong> I must admit, I kinda like that. Of course, all of this is just speculation. <em>There might not be a carpet to match at all.</em></p>
