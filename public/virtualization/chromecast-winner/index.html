  <p>A little over a month ago I announced the <a href="http://vninja.net/news/win-google-chromecast/">Want to Win a Google Chromecast</a>  contest and finally the winner has been selected. Since there was a grand total of 5 submissions, and one of them was immediately disqualified for a distinct lack of Ninja-presence, I decided to just do a random draw.</p>

<p><img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SubmittedPhotos.png" alt="SubmittedPhotos" /></p>

<p>The submitted photos were numbered by the order they appeared in on my post as I took this screenshot. I then put the number range 1 to 4 into <a href="http://random.org">random.org</a> and recorded the output</p>

<p>[video width=&ldquo;960&rdquo; height=&ldquo;540&rdquo; mp4=&ldquo;<a href="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Chromecast-Winner.mp4&quot;][/video">http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Chromecast-Winner.mp4&quot;][/video</a>]</p>

<p>By random selection, the winning submission is <strong>Ninja with Entourage</strong> submitted by <strong>Chad Singleton</strong>.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_3153&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;600&rdquo;]<img src="http://vninja.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BlvGOGFCMAE8Clw.jpg" alt="Chad Singleton" /> Chad Singleton[/caption]</p>

<p><em>Congratulations! Please contact me for shipping details, and I&rsquo;ll get the Chromecast sponsored by Veeam shipped in your direction as soon as possible! </em></p>
