<p>The last couple of days I&rsquo;ve been in training class, taking the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/Course.aspx?ID=6451B">6451B Planning, Deploying and Managing Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007</a> course.</p>

<p>One of the first things that got mentioned, was that for larger deployments you should not run System Center Configuration Manager virtually. Of course, this caught my eye as I&rsquo;m a proponent for the virtualize first &ldquo;movement&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It runs out that the reason for this is that Configuration Manager is somewhat poorly designed, as just about everything it receives from the clients in the network is placed in <a href="http://systemcentercentral.com/BlogDetails/tabid/143/IndexID/80792/Default.aspx">text based log files (inbox folder)</a> before being processed and pumped into the back-end SQL DB. SCCM lives for and eats <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb892790.aspx">log files</a> for a living.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are good reasons for this, especially back in the day when SCCM 2007 was developed, but in retrospect this seems to be a poor design choice. Especially since the IO intensity of writing text-based log files is high, and doesn&rsquo;t scale well when you have loads of clients which SCCM 2007 supposedly is designed for in the first place.</p>

<p>There are ways of alleviating the strain on the machine running SCCM, like running the SQL server on a different server and running the management console on your local computer (remember a Windows server is tuned, by default, to prioritize background tasks), but the fact remains that sum of all the small write operations SCCM constantly does to your storage puts a heavy strain on it.</p>

<p><strong>So, if you want to run SCCM 2007 virtualized in your environment, make sure your storage is up to the task and that you don&rsquo;t saturate it by deploying what is in essence management software. Perhaps it is better to run it on a physical server with adequate local storage, but don&rsquo;t blame it on virtualization, blame it on poor design in SCCM 2007.</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/en/us/configuration-manager/cm-vnext-beta.aspx">Configuration Manager 201</a>2, which is currently in beta 2, behaves better when it&rsquo;s released. If not, how will Microsoft defend not getting real performance when running it in Hyper-V (or any other Hypervisor).</p>
